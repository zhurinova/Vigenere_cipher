"Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes.

But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist     I really belie e he is Antichrist     I will ha e nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful sla e,' as you call yourself!

But how do you do?

I see I ha e frightened you sit down and tell me all the news."

It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well known Anna Pa lo na Scherer, maid of honor and fa orite of the Empress Marya Fedoro na. With these words she greeted Prince  asili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arri e at her reception.

Anna Pa lo na had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe  grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.

All her in itations without exception, written in French, and deli ered by a scarlet li eried footman that morning, ran as follows 

"If you ha e nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an e ening with a poor in alid is not too terrible, I shall be  ery charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10     Annette Scherer."

"Hea ens! what a  irulent attack!" replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception.

He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face.

He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court.

He went up to Anna Pa lo na, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.

"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's mind at rest," said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and e en irony could be discerned.

"Can one be well while suffering morally?

Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?" said Anna Pa lo na. "You are staying the whole e ening, I hope?"

"And the fete at the English ambassador's?

Today is Wednesday.

I must put in an appearance there," said the prince. "My daughter is coming for me to take me there."

"I thought today's fete had been canceled.

I confess all these festi ities and fireworks are becoming wearisome."

"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would ha e been put off," said the prince, who, like a wound up clock, by force of habit said things he did not e en wish to be belie ed.

"Don't tease!

Well, and what has been decided about No osiltse 's dispatch?

You know e erything."

"What can one say about it?" replied the prince in a cold, listless tone.

"What has been decided?

They ha e decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I belie e that we are ready to burn ours." Prince  asili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part.

Anna Pa lo na Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years, o erflowed with animation and impulsi eness.

To be an enthusiast had become her social  ocation and, sometimes e en when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her.

The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.

In the midst of a con ersation on political matters Anna Pa lo na burst out 

"Oh, don't speak to me of Austria.

Perhaps I don't understand things, but Austria ne er has wished, and does not wish, for war.

She is betraying us!

Russia alone must sa e Europe.

Our gracious so ereign recognizes his high  ocation and will be true to it.

That is the one thing I ha e faith in!

Our good and wonderful so ereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so  irtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his  ocation and crush the hydra of re olution, which has become more terrible than e er in the person of this murderer and  illain!

We alone must a enge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander's loftiness of soul.

She has refused to e acuate Malta.

She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret moti e in our actions.

What answer did No osiltse  get? None.

The English ha e not understood and cannot understand the self abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind.

And what ha e they promised?

Nothing!

And what little they ha e promised they will not perform!

Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is in incible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don't belie e a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either.

This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I ha e faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch.

He will sa e Europe!" She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.

"I think," said the prince with a smile, "that if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would ha e captured the King of Prussia's consent by assault.

You are so eloquent.

Will you gi e me a cup of tea?"

"In a moment.

A propos," she added, becoming calm again, "I am expecting two  ery interesting men tonight, le  icomte de Mortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best French families.

He is one of the genuine emigres, the good ones.

And also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker?

He has been recei ed by the Emperor.

Had you heard?"

"I shall be delighted to meet them," said the prince. "But tell me," he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief moti e of his  isit, "is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at  ienna?

The baron by all accounts is a poor creature." Prince  asili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedoro na to secure it for the baron.

Anna Pa lo na almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased with.

"Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister," was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.

As she named the Empress, Anna Pa lo na's face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere de otion and respect mingled with sadness, and this occurred e ery time she mentioned her illustrious patroness.

She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke beaucoup d'estime, and again her face clouded o er with sadness.

The prince was silent and looked indifferent.

But, with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pa lo na wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak he had done of a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she said 

"Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out e eryone has been enraptured by her?

They say she is amazingly beautiful."

The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.

"I often think," she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate con ersation     "I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed.

Why has fate gi en you two such splendid children? I don't speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don't like him," she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. "Two such charming children.

And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you don't deser e to ha e them."

And she smiled her ecstatic smile.

"I can't help it," said the prince.

"La ater would ha e said I lack the bump of paternity."

"Don't joke  I mean to ha e a serious talk with you.

Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son?

Between oursel es" (and her face assumed its melancholy expression), "he was mentioned at Her Majesty's and you were pitied...."

The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly, awaiting a reply.

He frowned.

"What would you ha e me do?" he said at last. "You know I did all a father could for their education, and they ha e both turned out fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an acti e one.

That is the only difference between them." He said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth  ery clearly re ealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.

"And why are children born to such men as you?

If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you with," said Anna Pa lo na, looking up pensi ely.

"I am your faithful sla e and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I ha e to bear. That is how I explain it to myself. It can't be helped!" He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture.

Anna Pa lo na meditated.

"Ha e you ne er thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?" she asked.

"They say old maids ha e a mania for matchmaking, and though I don't feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is  ery unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary Bolkonskaya." Prince  asili did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a mo ement of the head that he was considering this information.

"Do you know," he said at last, e idently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts, "that Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year? And," he went on after a pause, "what will it be in fi e years, if he goes on like this?"

Presently he added 

"That's what we fathers ha e to put up with....

Is this princess of yours rich?"

"Her father is  ery rich and stingy.

He li es in the country.

He is the well known Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the late Emperor, and was nicknamed 'the King of Prussia.'

He is  ery cle er but eccentric, and a bore.

The poor girl is  ery unhappy. She has a brother  I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately.

He is an aide de camp of Kutuzo 's and will be here tonight."

"Listen, dear Annette," said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pa lo na's hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. "Arrange that affair for me and I shall always be your most de oted sla e slafe with an f, as a  illage elder of mine writes in his reports.

She is rich and of good family and that's all I want."

And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the maid of honor's hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.

"Attendez," said Anna Pa lo na, reflecting, "I'll speak to Lise, young Bolkonski's wife, this  ery e ening, and perhaps the thing can be arranged.

It shall be on your family's behalf that I'll start my apprenticeship as old maid."

CHAPTER II

Anna Pa lo na's drawing room was gradually filling.

The highest Petersburg society was assembled there  people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged. Prince  asili's daughter, the beautiful Helene, came to take her father to the ambassador's entertainment  she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor.

The youthful little Princess Bolkonskaya, known as la femme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg,   was also there. She had been married during the pre ious winter, and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions.

Prince  asili's son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced. The Abbe Morio and many others had also come.

  The most fascinating woman in Petersburg. To each new arri al Anna Pa lo na said, "You ha e not yet seen my aunt," or "You do not know my aunt?" and  ery gra ely conducted him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arri e  and slowly turning her eyes from the  isitor to her aunt, Anna Pa lo na mentioned each one's name and then left them.

Each  isitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them cared about  Anna Pa lo na obser ed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent appro al.

The aunt spoke to each of them in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her Majesty, "who, thank God, was better today."

And each  isitor, though politeness pre ented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief at ha ing performed a  exatious duty and did not return to her the whole e ening.

The young Princess Bolkonskaya had brought some work in a gold embroidered  el et bag.

Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip.

As is always the case with a thoroughly attracti e woman, her defect     the shortness of her upper lip and her half open mouth     seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty.

E eryone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and carrying her burden so lightly.

Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life and health.

All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day.

The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the sil er samo ar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her.

"I ha e brought my work," said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present.

"Mind, Annette, I hope you ha e not played a wicked trick on me," she added, turning to her hostess. "You wrote that it was to be quite a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed."

And she spread out her arms to show her short waisted, lace trimmed, dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.

"Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone else," replied Anna Pa lo na.

"You know," said the princess in the same tone of  oice and still in French, turning to a general, "my husband is deserting me?

He is going to get himself killed.

Tell me what this wretched war is for?" she added, addressing Prince  asili, and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Helene.

"What a delightful woman this little princess is!" said Prince  asili to Anna Pa lo na.

One of the next arri als was a stout, hea ily built young man with close cropped hair, spectacles, the light colored breeches fashionable at that time, a  ery high ruffle, and a brown dress coat.

This stout young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezukho , a well known grandee of Catherine's time who now lay dying in Moscow.

The young man had not yet entered either the military or ci il ser ice, as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his first appearance in society.

Anna Pa lo na greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room.

But in spite of this lowest grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place, came o er her face when she saw Pierre enter.

Though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety could only ha e reference to the cle er though shy, but obser ant and natural, expression which distinguished him from e eryone else in that drawing room.

"It is  ery good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and  isit a poor in alid," said Anna Pa lo na, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her.

Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as if in search of something.

On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.

Anna Pa lo na's alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty's health.

Anna Pa lo na in dismay detained him with the words 

"Do you know the Abbe Morio? He is a most interesting man."

"Yes, I ha e heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is  ery interesting but hardly feasible."

"You think so?" rejoined Anna Pa lo na in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now committed a re erse act of impoliteness.

First he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away.

With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbe's plan chimerical.

"We will talk of it later," said Anna Pa lo na with a smile.

And ha ing got rid of this young man who did not know how to beha e, she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready to help at any point where the con ersation might happen to flag.

As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pa lo na mo ed about her drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the con ersational machine in steady, proper, and regular motion.

But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was e ident.

She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbe.

Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pa lo na's was the first he had attended in Russia.

He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any cle er con ersation that was to be heard.

Seeing the self confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something  ery profound.

At last he came up to Morio.

Here the con ersation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own  iews, as young people are fond of doing.

CHAPTER III

Anna Pa lo na's reception was in full swing.

The spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides.

With the exception of the aunt, beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had settled into three groups.

One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the abbe. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess Helene, Prince  asili's daughter, and the little Princess Bolkonskaya,  ery pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age.

The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pa lo na.

The  icomte was a nice looking young man with soft features and polished manners, who e idently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself.

Anna Pa lo na was ob iously ser ing him up as a treat to her guests.

As a cle er maitre d'hotel ser es up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would ha e cared to eat, so Anna Pa lo na ser ed up to her guests, first the  icomte and then the abbe, as peculiarly choice morsels.

The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc d'Enghien.

The  icomte said that the Duc d'Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte's hatred of him.

"Ah, yes!

Do tell us all about it,  icomte," said Anna Pa lo na, with a pleasant feeling that there was something a la Louis X  in the sound of that sentence  "Contez nous cela,  icomte."

The  icomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply.

Anna Pa lo na arranged a group round him, in iting e eryone to listen to his tale.

"The  icomte knew the duc personally," whispered Anna Pa lo na to of the guests. "The  icomte is a wonderful raconteur," said she to another. "How e idently he belongs to the best society," said she to a third  and the  icomte was ser ed up to the company in the choicest and most ad antageous style, like a well garnished joint of roast beef on a hot dish.

The  icomte wished to begin his story and ga e a subtle smile.

"Come o er here, Helene, dear," said Anna Pa lo na to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of another group.

The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the room     the smile of a perfectly beautiful woman.

With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and i y, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the pri ilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom     which in the fashion of those days were  ery much exposed     and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she mo ed toward Anna Pa lo na.

Helene was so lo ely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she e en appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too  ictorious beauty.

She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.

"How lo ely!" said e eryone who saw her  and the  icomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smile.

"Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience," said he, smilingly inclining his head.

The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary.

She smilingly waited.

All the time the story was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whene er the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pa lo na, at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor's face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.

The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Helene.

"Wait a moment, I'll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking of?" she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte.

"Fetch me my workbag."

There was a general mo ement as the princess, smiling and talking merrily to e eryone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat.

"Now I am all right," she said, and asking the  icomte to begin, she took up her work.

Prince Hippolyte, ha ing brought the workbag, joined the circle and mo ing a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.

Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly.

His features were like his sister's, but while in her case e erything was lit up by a joyous, self satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self confidence, while his body was thin and weak.

His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a  acant, wearied grimace, and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions.

"It's not going to be a ghost story?" said he, sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak.

"Why no, my dear fellow," said the astonished narrator, shrugging his shoulders.

"Because I hate ghost stories," said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered them.

He spoke with such self confidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was  ery witty or  ery stupid.

He was dressed in a dark green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayee, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.

The  icomte told his tale  ery neatly. It was an anecdote, then current, to the effect that the Duc d'Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to  isit Mademoiselle George  that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress' fa ors, and that in his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject, and was thus at the duc's mercy. The latter spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.

The story was  ery pretty and interesting, especially at the point where the ri als suddenly recognized one another  and the ladies looked agitated.

"Charming!" said Anna Pa lo na with an inquiring glance at the little princess.

"Charming!" whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story pre ented her from going on with it.

The  icomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue, but just then Anna Pa lo na, who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was talking too loudly and  ehemently with the abbe, so she hurried to the rescue.

Pierre had managed to start a con ersation with the abbe about the balance of power, and the latter, e idently interested by the young man's simple minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory.

Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why Anna Pa lo na disappro ed.

"The means are... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the people," the abbe was saying. "It is only necessary for one powerful nation like Russia     barbaric as she is said to be     to place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance ha ing for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would sa e the world!"

"But how are you to get that balance?" Pierre was beginning. At that moment Anna Pa lo na came up and, looking se erely at Pierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate.

The Italian's face instantly changed and assumed an offensi ely affected, sugary expression, e idently habitual to him when con ersing with women.

"I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I ha e had the honor of being recei ed, that I ha e not yet had time to think of the climate," said he.

Not letting the abbe and Pierre escape, Anna Pa lo na, the more con eniently to keep them under obser ation, brought them into the larger circle.

CHAPTER I 

Just then another  isitor entered the drawing room  Prince Andrew Bolkonski, the little princess' husband.

He was a  ery handsome young man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features.

E erything about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step, offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife.

It was e ident that he not only knew e eryone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them.

And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife.

He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna Pa lo na's hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.

"You are off to the war, Prince?" said Anna Pa lo na.

"General Kutuzo ," said Bolkonski, speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the general's name like a Frenchman, "has been pleased to take me as an aide de camp...."

"And Lise, your wife?"

"She will go to the country."

"Are you not ashamed to depri e us of your charming wife?"

"Andre," said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, "the  icomte has been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!"

Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away.

Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm.

Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoe er was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre's beaming face he ga e him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.

"There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?" said he to Pierre.

"I knew you would be here," replied Pierre. "I will come to supper with you. May I?" he added in a low  oice so as not to disturb the  icomte who was continuing his story.

"No, impossible!" said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre's hand to show that there was no need to ask the question.

He wished to say something more, but at that moment Prince  asili and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.

"You must excuse me, dear  icomte," said Prince  asili to the Frenchman, holding him down by the slee e in a friendly way to pre ent his rising. "This unfortunate fete at the ambassador's depri es me of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you.

I am  ery sorry to lea e your enchanting party," said he, turning to Anna Pa lo na.

His daughter, Princess Helene, passed between the chairs, lightly holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face.

Pierre gazed at her with rapturous, almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.

" ery lo ely," said Prince Andrew.

" ery," said Pierre.

In passing Prince  asili seized Pierre's hand and said to Anna Pa lo na 

"Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time I ha e seen him in society.

Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of cle er women."

Anna Pa lo na smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his father to be a connection of Prince  asili's.

The elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and o ertook Prince  asili in the anteroom.

All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tear worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear.

"How about my son Boris, Prince?" said she, hurrying after him into the anteroom. "I can't remain any longer in Petersburg.

Tell me what news I may take back to my poor boy."

Although Prince  asili listened reluctantly and not  ery politely to the elderly lady, e en betraying some impatience, she ga e him an ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go away.

"What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he would be transferred to the Guards at once?" said she.

"Belie e me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can," answered Prince  asili, "but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should ad ise you to appeal to Rumyantse  through Prince Golitsyn. That would be the best way."

The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskaya, belonging to one of the best families in Russia, but she was poor, and ha ing long been out of society had lost her former influential connections.

She had now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son.

It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince  asili that she had obtained an in itation to Anna Pa lo na's reception and had sat listening to the  icomte's story.

Prince  asili's words frightened her, an embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment  then she smiled again and clutched Prince  asili's arm more tightly.

"Listen to me, Prince," said she. "I ha e ne er yet asked you for anything and I ne er will again, nor ha e I e er reminded you of my father's friendship for you  but now I entreat you for God's sake to do this for my son     and I shall always regard you as a benefactor," she added hurriedly. "No, don't be angry, but promise!

I ha e asked Golitsyn and he has refused.

Be the kindhearted man you always were," she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.

"Papa, we shall be late," said Princess Helene, turning her beautiful head and looking o er her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door.

Influence in society, howe er, is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last.

Prince  asili knew this, and ha ing once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence.

But in Princess Drubetskaya's case he felt, after her second appeal, something like qualms of conscience.

She had reminded him of what was quite true  he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career.

Moreo er, he could see by her manners that she was one of those women     mostly mothers     who, ha ing once made up their minds, will not rest until they ha e gained their end, and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and e en to make scenes.

This last consideration mo ed him.

"My dear Anna Mikhaylo na," said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone, "it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask  but to pro e my de otion to you and how I respect your father's memory, I will do the impossible     your son shall be transferred to the Guards. Here is my hand on it.

Are you satisfied?"

"My dear benefactor!

This is what I expected from you     I knew your kindness!"

He turned to go.

"Wait     just a word!

When he has been transferred to the Guards..." she faltered. "You are on good terms with Michael Ilariono ich Kutuzo ... recommend Boris to him as adjutant!

Then I shall be at rest, and then..."

Prince  asili smiled.

"No, I won't promise that.

You don't know how Kutuzo  is pestered since his appointment as Commander in Chief.

He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies ha e conspired to gi e him all their sons as adjutants."

"No, but do promise! I won't let you go! My dear benefactor..."

"Papa," said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, "we shall be late."

"Well, au re oir! Good by!

You hear her?"

"Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?"

"Certainly  but about Kutuzo , I don't promise."

"Do promise, do promise,  asili!" cried Anna Mikhaylo na as he went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came naturally to her, but was now  ery ill suited to her careworn face.

Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts.

But as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold, artificial expression.

She returned to the group where the  icomte was still talking, and again pretended to listen, while waiting till it would be time to lea e.

Her task was accomplished.

CHAPTER  

"And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at Milan?" asked Anna Pa lo na, "and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations?

Adorable!

It is enough to make one's head whirl!

It is as if the whole world had gone crazy."

Prince Andrew looked Anna Pa lo na straight in the face with a sarcastic smile.

"'Dieu me la donne, gare a qui la touche!'   They say he was  ery fine when he said that," he remarked, repeating the words in Italian  "'Dio mi l'ha dato.

Guai a chi la tocchi!'"   God has gi en it to me, let him who touches it beware!

"I hope this will pro e the last drop that will make the glass run o er," Anna Pa lo na continued.

"The so ereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to e erything."

"The so ereigns?

I do not speak of Russia," said the  icomte, polite but hopeless  "The so ereigns, madame...

What ha e they done for Louis X II, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth?

Nothing!" and he became more animated. "And belie e me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause.

The so ereigns!

Why, they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper."

And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.

Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the  icomte for some time through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess, and ha ing asked for a needle began tracing the Conde coat of arms on the table.

He explained this to her with as much gra ity as if she had asked him to do it.

"Baton de gueules, engrele de gueules d'azur     maison Conde," said he.

The princess listened, smiling.

"If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer," the  icomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts, "things will ha e gone too far.

By intrigues,  iolence, exile, and executions, French society     I mean good French society     will ha e been fore er destroyed, and then..."

He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands.

Pierre wished to make a remark, for the con ersation interested him, but Anna Pa lo na, who had him under obser ation, interrupted 

"The Emperor Alexander," said she, with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, "has declared that he will lea e it to the French people themsel es to choose their own form of go ernment  and I belie e that once free from the usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king," she concluded, trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant.

"That is doubtful," said Prince Andrew. "Monsieur le  icomte quite rightly supposes that matters ha e already gone too far.

I think it will be difficult to return to the old regime."

"From what I ha e heard," said Pierre, blushing and breaking into the con ersation, "almost all the aristocracy has already gone o er to Bonaparte's side."

"It is the Buonapartists who say that," replied the  icomte without looking at Pierre. "At the present time it is difficult to know the real state of French public opinion."

"Bonaparte has said so," remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic smile.

It was e ident that he did not like the  icomte and was aiming his remarks at him, though without looking at him.

"'I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it,'" Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting Napoleon's words. "'I opened my antechambers and they crowded in.'

I do not know how far he was justified in saying so." "Not in the least," replied the  icomte. "After the murder of the duc e en the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero.

If to some people," he went on, turning to Anna Pa lo na, "he e er was a hero, after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in hea en and one hero less on earth."

Before Anna Pa lo na and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the  icomte's epigram, Pierre again broke into the con ersation, and though Anna Pa lo na felt sure he would say something inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.

"The execution of the Duc d'Enghien," declared Monsieur Pierre, "was a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed."

"Dieu! Mon Dieu!" muttered Anna Pa lo na in a terrified whisper.

"What, Monsieur Pierre...

Do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul?" said the little princess, smiling and drawing her work nearer to her.

"Oh!

Oh!" exclaimed se eral  oices.

"Capital!" said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand.

The  icomte merely shrugged his shoulders.

Pierre looked solemnly at his audience o er his spectacles and continued.

"I say so," he continued desperately, "because the Bourbons fled from the Re olution lea ing the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone understood the Re olution and quelled it, and so for the general good, he could not stop short for the sake of one man's life."

"Won't you come o er to the other table?" suggested Anna Pa lo na.

But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.

"No," cried he, becoming more and more eager, "Napoleon is great because he rose superior to the Re olution, suppressed its abuses, preser ed all that was good in it     equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press     and only for that reason did he obtain power."

"Yes, if ha ing obtained power, without a ailing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should ha e called him a great man," remarked the  icomte.

"He could not do that.

The people only ga e him power that he might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man.

The Re olution was a grand thing!" continued Monsieur Pierre, betraying by this desperate and pro ocati e proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.

"What? Re olution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that... But won't you come to this other table?" repeated Anna Pa lo na.

"Rousseau's Contrat social," said the  icomte with a tolerant smile.

"I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas."

"Yes  ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide," again interjected an ironical  oice.

"Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon has retained in full force."

"Liberty and equality," said the  icomte contemptuously, as if at last deciding seriously to pro e to this youth how foolish his words were, "high sounding words which ha e long been discredited.

Who does not lo e liberty and equality?

E en our Sa iour preached liberty and equality.

Ha e people since the Re olution become happier?

On the contrary.

We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it."

Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the  icomte and from the  icomte to their hostess.

In the first moment of Pierre's outburst Anna Pa lo na, despite her social experience, was horror struck. But when she saw that Pierre's sacrilegious words had not exasperated the  icomte, and had con inced herself that it was impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the  icomte in a  igorous attack on the orator.

"But, my dear Monsieur Pierre," said she, "how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc     or e en an ordinary man who     is innocent and untried?"

"I should like," said the  icomte, "to ask how monsieur explains the 18th Brumaire  was not that an imposture?

It was a swindle, and not at all like the conduct of a great man!"

"And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!" said the little princess, shrugging her shoulders.

"He's a low fellow, say what you will," remarked Prince Hippolyte.

Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled.

His smile was unlike the half smile of other people.

When he smiled, his gra e, e en rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by another     a childlike, kindly, e en rather silly look, which seemed to ask forgi eness.

The  icomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested.

All were silent.

"How do you expect him to answer you all at once?" said Prince Andrew. "Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a pri ate person, as a general, and as an emperor.

So it seems to me."

"Yes, yes, of course!" Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arri al of this reinforcement.

"One must admit," continued Prince Andrew, "that Napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he ga e his hand to the plague stricken  but... but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify."

Prince Andrew, who had e idently wished to tone down the awkwardness of Pierre's remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go.

Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to e eryone to attend, and asking them all to be seated began 

"I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it.

Excuse me,  icomte     I must tell it in Russian or the point will be lost...."

And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.

E eryone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his story.

"There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is  ery stingy.

She must ha e two footmen behind her carriage, and  ery big ones.

That was her taste.

And she had a lady's maid, also big.

She said..."

Here Prince Hippolyte paused, e idently collecting his ideas with difficulty.

"She said... Oh yes! She said, 'Girl,' to the maid, 'put on a li ery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some calls.'"

Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience, which produced an effect unfa orable to the narrator.

Se eral persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna Pa lo na, did howe er smile.

"She went.

Suddenly there was a great wind.

The girl lost her hat and her long hair came down...."

Here he could contain himself no longer and went on, between gasps of laughter 

"And the whole world knew...."

And so the anecdote ended.

Though it was unintelligible why he had told it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pa lo na and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte's social tact in so agreeably ending Pierre's unpleasant and unamiable outburst.

After the anecdote the con ersation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and where.

CHAPTER  I

Ha ing thanked Anna Pa lo na for her charming soiree, the guests began to take their lea e.

Pierre was ungainly.

Stout, about the a erage height, broad, with huge red hands  he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing room and still less how to lea e one  that is, how to say something particularly agreeable before going away.

Besides this he was absent minded.

When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the general's three cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume, till the general asked him to restore it.

All his absent mindedness and inability to enter a room and con erse in it was, howe er, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest expression.

Anna Pa lo na turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgi eness of his indiscretion, nodded and said 

"I hope to see you again, but I also hope you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre."

When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again e erybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps,

"Opinions are opinions, but you see what a capital, good natured fellow I am."

And e eryone, including Anna Pa lo na, felt this.

Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened indifferently to his wife's chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also come into the hall.

Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.

"Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold," said the little princess, taking lea e of Anna Pa lo na. "It is settled," she added in a low  oice.

Anna Pa lo na had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she contemplated between Anatole and the little princess' sister in law.

"I rely on you, my dear," said Anna Pa lo na, also in a low tone. "Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter.

Au re oir!"     and she left the hall.

Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face close to her, began to whisper something.

Two footmen, the princess' and his own, stood holding a shawl and a cloak, waiting for the con ersation to finish. They listened to the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so.

The princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.

"I am  ery glad I did not go to the ambassador's," said Prince Hippolyte " so dull . It has been a delightful e ening, has it not? Delightful!"

"They say the ball will be  ery good," replied the princess, drawing up her downy little lip. "All the pretty women in society will be there."

"Not all, for you will not be there  not all," said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully  and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he e en pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess.

Either from awkwardness or intentionally (no one could ha e said which) after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as though embracing her.

Still smiling, she gracefully mo ed away, turning and glancing at her husband.

Prince Andrew's eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did he seem.

"Are you ready?" he asked his wife, looking past her.

Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion reached to his  ery heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch following the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.

"Princesse, au re oir," cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet.

The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber  Prince Hippolyte, under pretense of helping, was in e eryone's way.

"Allow me, sir," said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold, disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.

"I am expecting you, Pierre," said the same  oice, but gently and affectionately.

The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled.

Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the  icomte whom he had promised to take home.

"Well, mon cher," said the  icomte, ha ing seated himself beside Hippolyte in the carriage, "your little princess is  ery nice,  ery nice indeed, quite French," and he kissed the tips of his fingers.

Hippolyte burst out laughing.

"Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs," continued the  icomte.

"I pity the poor husband, that little officer who gi es himself the airs of a monarch."

Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said,

"And you were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French?

One has to know how to deal with them."

Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew's study like one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was Caesar's Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle.

"What ha e you done to Mlle Scherer?

She will be quite ill now," said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white hands.

Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his eager face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and wa ed his hand.

"That abbe is  ery interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but     I do not know how to express it... not by a balance of political power...."

It was e ident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract con ersation.

"One can't e erywhere say all one thinks, mon cher.

Well, ha e you at last decided on anything?

Are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist?" asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.

Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.

"Really, I don't yet know.

I don't like either the one or the other."

"But you must decide on something!

Your father expects it."

Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor, and had remained away till he was twenty.

When he returned to Moscow his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man,

"Now go to Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession.

I will agree to anything.

Here is a letter to Prince  asili, and here is money.

Write to me all about it, and I will help you in e erything."

Pierre had already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided on anything.

It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking.

Pierre rubbed his forehead.

"But he must be a Freemason," said he, referring to the abbe whom he had met that e ening.

"That is all nonsense." Prince Andrew again interrupted him, "let us talk business.

Ha e you been to the Horse Guards?"

"No, I ha e not  but this is what I ha e been thinking and wanted to tell you.

There is a war now against Napoleon.

If it were a war for freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army  but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is not right."

Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre's childish words.

He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense, but it would in fact ha e been difficult to gi e any other answer than the one Prince Andrew ga e to this nai e question.

"If no one fought except on his own con iction, there would be no wars," he said.

"And that would be splendid," said Pierre.

Prince Andrew smiled ironically.

" ery likely it would be splendid, but it will ne er come about..."

"Well, why are you going to the war?" asked Pierre.

"What for? I don't know.

I must.

Besides that I am going..." He paused. "I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me!"

CHAPTER  II

The rustle of a woman's dress was heard in the next room.

Prince Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it had had in Anna Pa lo na's drawing room.

Pierre remo ed his feet from the sofa.

The princess came in.

She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other.

Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her.

"How is it," she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair, "how is it Annette ne er got married?

How stupid you men all are not to ha e married her!

Excuse me for saying so, but you ha e no sense about women.

What an argumentati e fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!"

"And I am still arguing with your husband. I can't understand why he wants to go to the war," replied Pierre, addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women.

The princess started.

E idently Pierre's words touched her to the quick.

"Ah, that is just what I tell him!" said she. "I don't understand it  I don't in the least understand why men can't li e without wars.

How is it that we women don't want anything of the kind, don't need it?

Now you shall judge between us.

I always tell him  Here he is Uncle's aide de camp, a most brilliant position.

He is so well known, so much appreciated by e eryone.

The other day at the Apraksins' I heard a lady asking,

'Is that the famous Prince Andrew?'

I did indeed." She laughed. "He is so well recei ed e erywhere.

He might easily become aide de camp to the Emperor.

You know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously.

Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it.

What do you think?"

Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the con ersation, ga e no reply.

"When are you starting?" he asked.

"Oh, don't speak of his going, don't!

I won't hear it spoken of," said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member. "Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off... and then you know, Andre..." (she looked significantly at her husband) "I'm afraid, I'm afraid!" she whispered, and a shudder ran down her back.

Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness.

"What is it you are afraid of, Lise?

I don't understand," said he.

"There, what egotists men all are  all, all egotists!

Just for a whim of his own, goodness only knows why, he lea es me and locks me up alone in the country."

"With my father and sister, remember," said Prince Andrew gently.

"Alone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to be afraid."

Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, gi ing her not a joyful, but an animal, squirrel like expression.

She paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the gist of the matter lay in that.

"I still can't understand what you are afraid of," said Prince Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.

The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.

"No, Andrew, I must say you ha e changed. Oh, how you ha e..."

"Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier," said Prince Andrew. "You had better go."

The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip qui ered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.

Pierre looked o er his spectacles with nai e surprise, now at him and now at her, mo ed as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.

"Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?" exclaimed the little princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace. "I ha e long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you ha e changed so to me?

What ha e I done to you?

You are going to the war and ha e no pity for me.

Why is it?"

"Lise!" was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an entreaty, a threat, and abo e all con iction that she would herself regret her words. But she went on hurriedly 

"You treat me like an in alid or a child.

I see it all!

Did you beha e like that six months ago?"

"Lise, I beg you to desist," said Prince Andrew still more emphatically.

Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this, rose and approached the princess.

He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.

"Calm yourself, Princess!

It seems so to you because... I assure you I myself ha e experienced... and so... because... No, excuse me! An outsider is out of place here... No, don't distress yourself... Good by!"

Prince Andrew caught him by the hand.

"No, wait, Pierre!

The princess is too kind to wish to depri e me of the pleasure of spending the e ening with you."

"No, he thinks only of himself," muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears.

"Lise!" said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his  oice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted.

Suddenly the angry, squirrel like expression of the princess' pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husband's face, and her own assumed the timid, deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail.

"Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!" she muttered, and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.

"Good night, Lise," said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would ha e done to a stranger.

CHAPTER  III

The friends were silent.

Neither cared to begin talking.

Pierre continually glanced at Prince Andrew  Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand.

"Let us go and ha e supper," he said with a sigh, going to the door.

They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room.

E erything from the table napkins to the sil er, china, and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married.

Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and, with a look of ner ous agitation such as Pierre had ne er before seen on his face, began to talk     as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out.

"Ne er, ne er marry, my dear fellow! That's my ad ice  ne er marry till you can say to yourself that you ha e done all you are capable of, and until you ha e ceased to lo e the woman of your choice and ha e seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irre ocable mistake.

Marry when you are old and good for nothing     or all that is good and noble in you will be lost.

It will all be wasted on trifles.

Yes! Yes! Yes!

Don't look at me with such surprise.

If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at e ery step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot!... But what's the good?..." and he wa ed his arm.

Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and the good natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend in amazement.

"My wife," continued Prince Andrew, "is an excellent woman, one of those rare women with whom a man's honor is safe  but, O God, what would I not gi e now to be unmarried!

You are the first and only one to whom I mention this, because I like you."

As he said this Prince Andrew was less than e er like that Bolkonski who had lolled in Anna Pa lo na's easy chairs and with half closed eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth.

E ery muscle of his thin face was now qui ering with ner ous excitement  his eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant light.

It was e ident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation.

"You don't understand why I say this," he continued, "but it is the whole story of life.

You talk of Bonaparte and his career," said he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), "but Bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing but his aim to consider, and he reached it.

But tie yourself up with a woman and, like a chained con ict, you lose all freedom!

And all you ha e of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret.

Drawing rooms, gossip, balls,  anity, and tri iality     these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from.

I am now going to the war, the greatest war there e er was, and I know nothing and am fit for nothing.

I am  ery amiable and ha e a caustic wit," continued Prince Andrew, "and at Anna Pa lo na's they listen to me.

And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women... If you only knew what those society women are, and women in general!

My father is right.

Selfish,  ain, stupid, tri ial in e erything     that's what women are when you see them in their true colors!

When you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them, but there's nothing, nothing, nothing!

No, don't marry, my dear fellow  don't marry!" concluded Prince Andrew.

"It seems funny to me," said Pierre, "that you, you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life.

You ha e e erything before you, e erything.

And you..."

He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.

"How can he talk like that?" thought Pierre.

He considered his friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest degree just the  ery qualities Pierre lacked, and which might be best described as strength of will.

Pierre was always astonished at Prince Andrew's calm manner of treating e erybody, his extraordinary memory, his extensi e reading (he had read e erything, knew e erything, and had an opinion about e erything), but abo e all at his capacity for work and study.

And if Pierre was often struck by Andrew's lack of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was particularly addicted), he regarded e en this not as a defect but as a sign of strength.

E en in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly.

"My part is played out," said Prince Andrew. "What's the use of talking about me?

Let us talk about you," he added after a silence, smiling at his reassuring thoughts.

That smile was immediately reflected on Pierre's face.

"But what is there to say about me?" said Pierre, his face relaxing into a careless, merry smile. "What am I?

An illegitimate son!" He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this. "Without a name and without means... And it really..." But he did not say what "it really" was.

"For the present I am free and am all right.

Only I ha en't the least idea what I am to do  I wanted to consult you seriously."

Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance     friendly and affectionate as it was     expressed a sense of his own superiority.

"I am fond of you, especially as you are the one li e man among our whole set.

Yes, you're all right!

Choose what you will  it's all the same.

You'll be all right anywhere. But look here  gi e up  isiting those Kuragins and leading that sort of life.

It suits you so badly     all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!"

"What would you ha e, my dear fellow?" answered Pierre, shrugging his shoulders. "Women, my dear fellow  women!"

"I don't understand it," replied Prince Andrew. "Women who are comme il faut, that's a different matter  but the Kuragins' set of women, 'women and wine' I don't understand!"

Pierre was staying at Prince  asili Kuragin's and sharing the dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to Prince Andrew's sister.

"Do you know?" said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy thought, "seriously, I ha e long been thinking of it....

Leading such a life I can't decide or think properly about anything.

One's head aches, and one spends all one's money.

He asked me for tonight, but I won't go."

"You gi e me your word of honor not to go?"

"On my honor!"

CHAPTER IX

It was past one o'clock when Pierre left his friend.

It was a cloudless, northern, summer night.

Pierre took an open cab intending to dri e straight home.

But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night.

It was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or e ening than night.

On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kuragin was expecting the usual set for cards that e ening, after which there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with  isits of a kind Pierre was  ery fond of.

"I should like to go to Kuragin's," thought he.

But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go there.

Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go.

The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he ga e it he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering  "besides," thought he, "all such 'words of honor' are con entional things with no definite meaning, especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same!"

Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying all his decisions and intentions.

He went to Kuragin's.

Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards' barracks, in which Anatole li ed, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs, and went in at the open door.

There was no one in the anteroom  empty bottles, cloaks, and o ershoes were lying about  there was a smell of alcohol, and sounds of  oices and shouting in the distance.

Cards and supper were o er, but the  isitors had not yet dispersed.

Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses.

From the third room came sounds of laughter, the shouting of familiar  oices, the growling of a bear, and general commotion.

Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window.

Three others were romping with a young bear, one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.

"I bet a hundred on Ste ens!" shouted one.

"Mind, no holding on!" cried another.

"I bet on Dolokho !" cried a third. "Kuragin, you part our hands."

"There, lea e Bruin alone  here's a bet on."

"At one draught, or he loses!" shouted a fourth.

"Jacob, bring a bottle!" shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front. "Wait a bit, you fellows....

Here is Petya! Good man!" cried he, addressing Pierre.

Another  oice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes, particularly striking among all these drunken  oices by its sober ring, cried from the window 

"Come here  part the bets!"

This was Dolokho , an officer of the Semeno  regiment, a notorious gambler and duelist, who was li ing with Anatole.

Pierre smiled, looking about him merrily.

"I don't understand.

What's it all about?"

"Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet!

A bottle here," said Anatole, taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.

"First of all you must drink!"

Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening to their chatter.

Anatole kept on refilling Pierre's glass while explaining that Dolokho  was betting with Ste ens, an English na al officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.

"Go on, you must drink it all," said Anatole, gi ing Pierre the last glass, "or I won't let you go!"

"No, I won't," said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to the window.

Dolokho  was holding the Englishman's hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to Anatole and Pierre.

Dolokho  was of medium height, with curly hair and light blue eyes.

He was about twenty fi e.

Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly seen.

The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely cur ed.

The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth  this, together with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face.

Dolokho  was a man of small means and no connections.

Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, Dolokho  li ed with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him more than they did Anatole.

Dolokho  could play all games and nearly always won.

Howe er much he drank, he ne er lost his clearheadedness.

Both Kuragin and Dolokho  were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg.

The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which pre ented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who were e idently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around.

Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window.

He wanted to smash something.

Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but could not mo e it.

He smashed a pane.

"You ha e a try, Hercules," said he, turning to Pierre.

Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash.

"Take it right out, or they'll think I'm holding on," said Dolokho .

"Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?" said Anatole.

"First rate," said Pierre, looking at Dolokho , who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was  isible.

Dolokho , the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window sill.

"Listen!" cried he, standing there and addressing those in the room.

All were silent.

"I bet fifty imperials"     he spoke French that the Englishman might understand him, but he did, not speak it  ery well     "I bet fifty imperials... or do you wish to make it a hundred?" added he, addressing the Englishman.

"No, fifty," replied the latter.

"All right. Fifty imperials... that I will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this spot" (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window) "and without holding on to anything. Is that right?"

"Quite right," said the Englishman.

Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at him     the Englishman was short     began repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.

"Wait!" cried Dolokho , hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention. "Wait a bit, Kuragin. Listen!

If anyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials.

Do you understand?"

The Englishman nodded, but ga e no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not.

Anatole did not release him, and though he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating Dolokho 's words into English.

A thin young lad, an hussar of the Life Guards, who had been losing that e ening, climbed on the window sill, leaned o er, and looked down.

"Oh! Oh! Oh!" he muttered, looking down from the window at the stones of the pa ement.

"Shut up!" cried Dolokho , pushing him away from the window. The lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping o er his spurs.

Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily, Dolokho  climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs.

Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself on his seat, lowered his hands, mo ed a little to the right and then to the left, and took up the bottle.

Anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light.

Dolokho 's back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both sides.

E eryone crowded to the window, the Englishman in front.

Pierre stood smiling but silent.

One man, older than the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of Dolokho 's shirt.

"I say, this is folly! He'll be killed," said this more sensible man.

Anatole stopped him.

"Don't touch him! You'll startle him and then he'll be killed.

Eh?... What then?... Eh?"

Dolokho  turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged himself on his seat.

"If anyone comes meddling again," said he, emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips, "I will throw him down there.

Now then!"

Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand to balance himself.

One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from Dolokho 's back.

Anatole stood erect with staring eyes.

The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips.

The man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall.

Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear.

All were still.

Pierre took his hands from his eyes. Dolokho  still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort.

The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back.

"Why is it so long?" thought Pierre.

It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed.

Suddenly Dolokho  made a backward mo ement with his spine, and his arm trembled ner ously  this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge.

As he began slipping down, his head and arm wa ered still more with the strain.

One hand mo ed as if to clutch the window sill, but refrained from touching it.

Pierre again co ered his eyes and thought he would ne er open them again.

Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around.

He looked up  Dolokho  was standing on the window sill, with a pale but radiant face.

"It's empty."

He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly.

Dolokho  jumped down.

He smelt strongly of rum.

"Well done!...

Fine fellow!...

There's a bet for you!...

De il take you!" came from different sides.

The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money.

Dolokho  stood frowning and did not speak.

Pierre jumped upon the window sill.

"Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me?

I'll do the same thing!" he suddenly cried. "E en without a bet, there!

Tell them to bring me a bottle.

I'll do it.... Bring a bottle!"

"Let him do it, let him do it," said Dolokho , smiling.

"What next? Ha e you gone mad?...

No one would let you!...

Why, you go giddy e en on a staircase," exclaimed se eral  oices.

"I'll drink it! Let's ha e a bottle of rum!" shouted Pierre, banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window.

They seized him by his arms  but he was so strong that e eryone who touched him was sent flying.

"No, you'll ne er manage him that way," said Anatole. "Wait a bit and I'll get round him....

Listen! I'll take your bet tomorrow, but now we are all going to         's."

"Come on then," cried Pierre. "Come on!... And we'll take Bruin with us."

And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground, and began dancing round the room with it.

CHAPTER X

Prince  asili kept the promise he had gi en to Princess Drubetskaya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Boris on the e ening of Anna Pa lo na's soiree.

The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an exception made, and Boris transferred into the regiment of Semeno  Guards with the rank of cornet.

He recei ed, howe er, no appointment to Kutuzo 's staff despite all Anna Mikhaylo na's endea ors and entreaties.

Soon after Anna Pa lo na's reception Anna Mikhaylo na returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the Rosto s, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling Bory, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from childhood and li ed for years at a time.

The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to Radzi ilo .

It was St. Natalia's day and the name day of two of the Rosto s     the mother and the youngest daughter     both named Nataly.

E er since the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually, bringing  isitors to the Countess Rosto a's big house on the Po arskaya, so well known to all Moscow.

The countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the  isitors who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in relays.

The countess was a woman of about forty fi e, with a thin Oriental type of face, e idently worn out with childbearing     she had had twel e.

A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, ga e her a distinguished air which inspired respect.

Princess Anna Mikhaylo na Drubetskaya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room, helped to recei e and entertain the  isitors.

The young people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to take part in recei ing the  isitors.

The count met the guests and saw them off, in iting them all to dinner.

"I am  ery,  ery grateful to you, mon cher," or "ma chere"     he called e eryone without exception and without the slightest  ariation in his tone, "my dear," whether they were abo e or below him in rank     "I thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping.

But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended, ma chere!

On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come, mon cher!"

These words he repeated to e eryone without exception or  ariation, and with the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean sha en face, the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows.

As soon as he had seen a  isitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to li e, he swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in  ery bad but self confident French  then again, like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some  isitors off and, stroking his scanty gray hairs o er his bald patch, also asked them to dinner.

Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conser atory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables were being set out for eighty people  and looking at the footmen, who were bringing in sil er and china, mo ing tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would call Dmitri  asile ich, a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say 

"Well, Dmitri, you'll see that things are all as they should be?

That's right! The great thing is the ser ing, that's it."

And with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room.

"Marya L o na Karagina and her daughter!" announced the countess' gigantic footman in his bass  oice, entering the drawing room.

The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husband's portrait on it.

"I'm quite worn out by these callers. Howe er, I'll see her and no more.

She is so affected.

Ask her in," she said to the footman in a sad  oice, as if saying  " ery well, finish me off."

A tall, stout, and proud looking woman, with a round faced smiling daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.

"Dear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child... at the Razumo ski's ball... and Countess Apraksina... I was so delighted..." came the sounds of animated feminine  oices, interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs.

Then one of those con ersations began which last out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say,

"I am so delighted... Mamma's health... and Countess Apraksina..." and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and dri e away.

The con ersation was on the chief topic of the day  the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherine's day, Count Bezukho , and about his illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had beha ed so improperly at Anna Pa lo na's reception.

"I am so sorry for the poor count," said the  isitor. "He is in such bad health, and now this  exation about his son is enough to kill him!"

"What is that?" asked the countess as if she did not know what the  isitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of Count Bezukho 's distress some fifteen times.

"That's what comes of a modern education," exclaimed the  isitor.

"It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police."

"You don't say so!" replied the countess.

"He chose his friends badly," interposed Anna Mikhaylo na. "Prince  asili's son, he, and a certain Dolokho  ha e, it is said, been up to hea en only knows what!

And they ha e had to suffer for it.

Dolokho  has been degraded to the ranks and Bezukho 's son sent back to Moscow.

Anatole Kuragin's father managed somehow to get his son's affair hushed up, but e en he was ordered out of Petersburg."

"But what ha e they been up to?" asked the countess.

"They are regular brigands, especially Dolokho ," replied the  isitor. "He is a son of Marya I ano na Dolokho a, such a worthy woman, but there, just fancy!

Those three got hold of a bear somewhere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to  isit some actresses!

The police tried to interfere, and what did the young men do?

They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back!"

"What a nice figure the policeman must ha e cut, my dear!" shouted the count, dying with laughter.

"Oh, how dreadful!

How can you laugh at it, Count?"

Yet the ladies themsel es could not help laughing.

"It was all they could do to rescue the poor man," continued the  isitor. "And to think it is Cyril  ladimiro ich Bezukho 's son who amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so well educated and cle er.

This is all that his foreign education has done for him!

I hope that here in Moscow no one will recei e him, in spite of his money.

They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite declined  I ha e my daughters to consider."

"Why do you say this young man is so rich?" asked the countess, turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention. "His children are all illegitimate.

I think Pierre also is illegitimate."

The  isitor made a gesture with her hand.

"I should think he has a score of them."

Princess Anna Mikhaylo na inter ened in the con ersation, e idently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society.

"The fact of the matter is," said she significantly, and also in a half whisper, "e eryone knows Count Cyril's reputation.... He has lost count of his children, but this Pierre was his fa orite."

"How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!" remarked the countess.

"I ha e ne er seen a handsomer man."

"He is  ery much altered now," said Anna Mikhaylo na. "Well, as I was saying, Prince  asili is the next heir through his wife, but the count is  ery fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to the Emperor about him  so that in the case of his death     and he is so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from Petersburg     no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre or Prince  asili.

Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles!

I know it all  ery well for Prince  asili told me himself.

Besides, Cyril  ladimiro ich is my mother's second cousin.

He's also my Bory's godfather," she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the fact.

"Prince  asili arri ed in Moscow yesterday.

I hear he has come on some inspection business," remarked the  isitor.

"Yes, but between oursel es," said the princess, "that is a pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril  ladimiro ich, hearing how ill he is."

"But do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke," said the count  and seeing that the elder  isitor was not listening, he turned to the young ladies. "I can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut!"

And as he wa ed his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats well and, in particular, drinks well. "So do come and dine with us!" he said.

CHAPTER XI

Silence ensued.

The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably, but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their lea e.

The  isitor's daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling o er, and a girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room.

It was e ident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far.

Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy faced boy in a short jacket.

The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in.

"Ah, here she is!" he exclaimed laughing. "My pet, whose name day it is.

My dear pet!"

"Ma chere, there is a time for e erything," said the countess with feigned se erity. "You spoil her, Ilya," she added, turning to her husband.

"How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name day," said the  isitor. "What a charming child," she added, addressing the mother.

This black eyed, wide mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life     with childish bare shoulders which after her run hea ed and shook her bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs in lace frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers     was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not yet a young woman.

Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mother's mantilla     not paying the least attention to her se ere remark     and began to laugh.

She laughed, and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock.

"Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see..." was all Natasha managed to utter (to her e erything seemed funny).

She leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that e en the prim  isitor could not help joining in.

"Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you," said the mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning to the  isitor she added  "She is my youngest girl."

Natasha, raising her face for a moment from her mother's mantilla, glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.

The  isitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it necessary to take some part in it.

"Tell me, my dear," said she to Natasha, "is Mimi a relation of yours?

A daughter, I suppose?"

Natasha did not like the  isitor's tone of condescension to childish things.

She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.

Meanwhile the younger generation  Boris, the officer, Anna Mikhaylo na's son  Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count's eldest son  Sonya, the count's fifteen year old niece, and little Petya, his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were ob iously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces.

E idently in the back rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the con ersation had been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals, the weather, and Countess Apraksina. Now and then they glanced at one another, hardly able to suppress their laughter.

The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood, were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike.

Boris was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression.

Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm.

Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room.

He e idently tried to find something to say, but failed. Boris on the contrary at once found his footing, and related quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken  how she had aged during the fi e years he had known her, and how her head had cracked right across the skull.

Ha ing said this he glanced at Natasha.

She turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her.

Boris did not laugh.

"You were meaning to go out, weren't you, Mamma?

Do you want the carriage?" he asked his mother with a smile.

"Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready," she answered, returning his smile.

Boris quietly left the room and went in search of Natasha. The plump boy ran after them angrily, as if  exed that their program had been disturbed.

CHAPTER XII

The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the young lady  isitor and the countess' eldest daughter (who was four years older than her sister and beha ed already like a grown up person), were Nicholas and Sonya, the niece.

Sonya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were  eiled by long lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck.

By the grace of her mo ements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain coyness and reser e of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat.

She e idently considered it proper to show an interest in the general con ersation by smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like Natasha and Boris, escape from the drawing room.

"Ah yes, my dear," said the count, addressing the  isitor and pointing to Nicholas, "his friend Boris has become an officer, and so for friendship's sake he is lea ing the uni ersity and me, his old father, and entering the military ser ice, my dear.

And there was a place and e erything waiting for him in the Archi es Department!

Isn't that friendship?" remarked the count in an inquiring tone.

"But they say that war has been declared," replied the  isitor.

"They' e been saying so a long while," said the count, "and they'll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it.

My dear, there's friendship for you," he repeated. "He's joining the hussars."

The  isitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.

"It's not at all from friendship," declared Nicholas, flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. "It is not from friendship at all  I simply feel that the army is my  ocation."

He glanced at his cousin and the young lady  isitor  and they were both regarding him with a smile of approbation.

"Schubert, the colonel of the Pa lograd Hussars, is dining with us today.

He has been here on lea e and is taking Nicholas back with him.

It can't be helped!" said the count, shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that e idently distressed him.

"I ha e already told you, Papa," said his son, "that if you don't wish to let me go, I'll stay.

But I know I am no use anywhere except in the army  I am not a diplomat or a go ernment clerk.     I don't know how to hide what I feel." As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at Sonya and the young lady  isitor.

The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.

"All right, all right!" said the old count. "He always flares up!

This Buonaparte has turned all their heads  they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became Emperor.

Well, well, God grant it," he added, not noticing his  isitor's sarcastic smile.

The elders began talking about Bonaparte.

Julie Karagina turned to young Rosto .

"What a pity you weren't at the Arkharo s' on Thursday.

It was so dull without you," said she, gi ing him a tender smile.

The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential con ersation without at all noticing that his in oluntary smile had stabbed the heart of Sonya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk he glanced round at her.

She ga e him a passionately angry glance, and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips, she got up and left the room.

All Nicholas' animation  anished.

He waited for the first pause in the con ersation, and then with a distressed face left the room to find Sonya.

"How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their slee es!" said Anna Mikhaylo na, pointing to Nicholas as he went out. "Cousinage     dangereux  oisinage "   she added.   Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.

"Yes," said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had  anished  and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind, "and how much suffering, how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now!

And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy.

One is always, always anxious!

Especially just at this age, so dangerous both for girls and boys."

"It all depends on the bringing up," remarked the  isitor.

"Yes, you're quite right," continued the countess. "Till now I ha e always, thank God, been my children's friend and had their full confidence," said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children ha e no secrets from them. "I know I shall always be my daughters' first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with his impulsi e nature, does get into mischief (a boy can't help it), he will all the same ne er be like those Petersburg young men."

"Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters," chimed in the count, who always sol ed questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that e erything was splendid. "Just fancy  wants to be an hussar.

What's one to do, my dear?"

"What a charming creature your younger girl is," said the  isitor  "a little  olcano!"

"Yes, a regular  olcano," said the count. "Takes after me!

And what a  oice she has  though she's my daughter, I tell the truth when I say she'll be a singer, a second Salomoni!

We ha e engaged an Italian to gi e her lessons."

"Isn't she too young?

I ha e heard that it harms the  oice to train it at that age."

"Oh no, not at all too young!" replied the count. "Why, our mothers used to be married at twel e or thirteen."

"And she's in lo e with Boris already.

Just fancy!" said the countess with a gentle smile, looking at Boris' and went on, e idently concerned with a thought that always occupied her  "Now you see if I were to be se ere with her and to forbid it... goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly" (she meant that they would be kissing), "but as it is, I know e ery word she utters.

She will come running to me of her own accord in the e ening and tell me e erything.

Perhaps I spoil her, but really that seems the best plan.

With her elder sister I was stricter."

"Yes, I was brought up quite differently," remarked the handsome elder daughter, Countess  era, with a smile.

But the smile did not enhance  era's beauty as smiles generally do  on the contrary it ga e her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant, expression.

 era was good looking, not at all stupid, quick at learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant  oice  what she said was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, e eryone     the  isitors and countess alike     turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it, and they all felt awkward.

"People are always too cle er with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them," said the  isitor.

"What's the good of denying it, my dear?

Our dear countess was too cle er with  era," said the count. "Well, what of that? She's turned out splendidly all the same," he added, winking at  era.

The guests got up and took their lea e, promising to return to dinner.

"What manners!

I thought they would ne er go," said the countess, when she had seen her guests out.

CHAPTER XIII

When Natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conser atory.

There she paused and stood listening to the con ersation in the drawing room, waiting for Boris to come out.

She was already growing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming at once, when she heard the young man's discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly.

At this Natasha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there.

Boris paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little dust from the slee e of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined his handsome face.

Natasha,  ery still, peered out from her ambush, waiting to see what he would do.

He stood a little while before the glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door.

Natasha was about to call him but changed her mind.

"Let him look for me," thought she.

Hardly had Boris gone than Sonya, flushed, in tears, and muttering angrily, came in at the other door.

Natasha checked her first impulse to run out to her, and remained in her hiding place, watching     as under an in isible cap     to see what went on in the world.

She was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure.

Sonya, muttering to herself, kept looking round toward the drawing room door.

It opened and Nicholas came in.

"Sonya, what is the matter with you?

How can you?" said he, running up to her.

"It's nothing, nothing  lea e me alone!" sobbed Sonya.

"Ah, I know what it is."

"Well, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!"

"So o onya!

Look here!

How can you torture me and yourself like that, for a mere fancy?" said Nicholas taking her hand.

Sonya did not pull it away, and left off crying.

Natasha, not stirring and scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes.

"What will happen now?" thought she.

"Sonya!

What is anyone in the world to me?

You alone are e erything!" said Nicholas. "And I will pro e it to you."

"I don't like you to talk like that."

"Well, then, I won't  only forgi e me, Sonya!" He drew her to him and kissed her.

"Oh, how nice," thought Natasha  and when Sonya and Nicholas had gone out of the conser atory she followed and called Boris to her.

"Boris, come here," said she with a sly and significant look. "I ha e something to tell you.

Here, here!" and she led him into the conser atory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding.

Boris followed her, smiling.

"What is the something?" asked he.

She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown down on one of the tubs, picked it up.

"Kiss the doll," said she.

Boris looked attenti ely and kindly at her eager face, but did not reply.

"Don't you want to?

Well, then, come here," said she, and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll. "Closer, closer!" she whispered.

She caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed face.

"And me? Would you like to kiss me?" she whispered almost inaudibly, glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying from excitement.

Boris blushed.

"How funny you are!" he said, bending down to her and blushing still more, but he waited and did nothing.

Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him abo e his neck, and, tossing back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.

Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs and stood, hanging her head.

"Natasha," he said, "you know that I lo e you, but..."

"You are in lo e with me?" Natasha broke in.

"Yes, I am, but please don't let us do like that.... In another four years... then I will ask for your hand."

Natasha considered.

"Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen," she counted on her slender little fingers. "All right!

Then it's settled?"

A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.

"Settled!" replied Boris.

"Fore er?" said the little girl. "Till death itself?"

She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting room.

CHAPTER XI 

After recei ing her  isitors, the countess was so tired that she ga e orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to in ite to dinner all who came "to congratulate."

The countess wished to ha e a tete a tete talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna Mikhaylo na, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from Petersburg.

Anna Mikhaylo na, with her tear worn but pleasant face, drew her chair nearer to that of the countess.

"With you I will be quite frank," said Anna Mikhaylo na. "There are not many left of us old friends!

That's why I so  alue your friendship."

Anna Mikhaylo na looked at  era and paused.

The countess pressed her friend's hand.

" era," she said to her eldest daughter who was e idently not a fa orite, "how is it you ha e so little tact?

Don't you see you are not wanted here?

Go to the other girls, or..."

The handsome  era smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt.

"If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would ha e gone," she replied as she rose to go to her own room.

But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting, one pair at each window.

She stopped and smiled scornfully.

Sonya was sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some  erses for her, the first he had e er written.

Boris and Natasha were at the other window and ceased talking when  era entered.

Sonya and Natasha looked at  era with guilty, happy faces.

It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in lo e  but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in  era.

"How often ha e I asked you not to take my things?" she said. "You ha e a room of your own," and she took the inkstand from Nicholas.

"In a minute, in a minute," he said, dipping his pen.

"You always manage to do things at the wrong time," continued  era. "You came rushing into the drawing room so that e eryone felt ashamed of you."

Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that  ery reason no one replied, and the four simply looked at one another.

She lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand.

"And at your age what secrets can there be between Natasha and Boris, or between you two? It's all nonsense!"

"Now,  era, what does it matter to you?" said Natasha in defense, speaking  ery gently.

She seemed that day to be more than e er kind and affectionate to e eryone.

" ery silly," said  era. "I am ashamed of you.

Secrets indeed!"

"All ha e secrets of their own," answered Natasha, getting warmer. "We don't interfere with you and Berg."

"I should think not," said  era, "because there can ne er be anything wrong in my beha ior.

But I'll just tell Mamma how you are beha ing with Boris."

"Natalya Ilynichna beha es  ery well to me," remarked Boris. "I ha e nothing to complain of."

"Don't, Boris! You are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome," said Natasha in a mortified  oice that trembled slightly. (She used the word "diplomat," which was just then much in  ogue among the children, in the special sense they attached to it.) "Why does she bother me?"

And she added, turning to  era, "You'll ne er understand it, because you' e ne er lo ed anyone. You ha e no heart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing more" (this nickname, bestowed on  era by Nicholas, was considered  ery stinging), "and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people!

Go and flirt with Berg as much as you please," she finished quickly.

"I shall at any rate not run after a young man before  isitors..."

"Well, now you' e done what you wanted," put in Nicholas     "said unpleasant things to e eryone and upset them.

Let's go to the nursery."

All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.

"The unpleasant things were said to me," remarked  era, "I said none to anyone."

"Madame de Genlis!

Madame de Genlis!" shouted laughing  oices through the door.

The handsome  era, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on e eryone, smiled and, e idently unmo ed by what had been said to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf.

Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer.

In the drawing room the con ersation was still going on.

"Ah, my dear," said the countess, "my life is not all roses either.

Don't I know that at the rate we are li ing our means won't last long?

It's all the Club and his easygoing nature.

E en in the country do we get any rest?

Theatricals, hunting, and hea en knows what besides!

But don't let's talk about me  tell me how you managed e erything.

I often wonder at you, Annette     how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those ministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all!

It's quite astonishing.

How did you get things settled?

I couldn't possibly do it." "Ah, my lo e," answered Anna Mikhaylo na, "God grant you ne er know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you lo e to distraction!

One learns many things then," she added with a certain pride. "That lawsuit taught me much.

When I want to see one of those big people I write a note  'Princess So and So desires an inter iew with So and So,' and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or four times     till I get what I want.

I don't mind what they think of me."

"Well, and to whom did you apply about Bory?" asked the countess. "You see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas is going as a cadet.

There's no one to interest himself for him.

To whom did you apply?"

"To Prince  asili.

He was so kind.

He at once agreed to e erything, and put the matter before the Emperor," said Princess Anna Mikhaylo na enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her end.

"Has Prince  asili aged much?" asked the countess. "I ha e not seen him since we acted together at the Rumyantso s' theatricals.

I expect he has forgotten me.

He paid me attentions in those days," said the countess, with a smile.

"He is just the same as e er," replied Anna Mikhaylo na, "o erflowing with amiability.

His position has not turned his head at all. He said to me,

'I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear Princess. I am at your command.'

Yes, he is a fine fellow and a  ery kind relation.

But, Nataly, you know my lo e for my son  I would do anything for his happiness!

And my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one," continued Anna Mikhaylo na, sadly, dropping her  oice.

"My wretched lawsuit takes all I ha e and makes no progress.

Would you belie e it, I ha e literally not a penny and don't know how to equip Boris." She took out her handkerchief and began to cry. "I need fi e hundred rubles, and ha e only one twenty fi e ruble note.

I am in such a state.... My only hope now is in Count Cyril  ladimiro ich Bezukho .

If he will not assist his godson     you know he is Bory's godfather     and allow him something for his maintenance, all my trouble will ha e been thrown away.... I shall not be able to equip him."

The countess' eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.

"I often think, though, perhaps it's a sin," said the princess, "that here li es Count Cyril  ladimiro ich Bezukho  so rich, all alone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth?

It's a burden to him, and Bory's life is only just beginning...."

"Surely he will lea e something to Boris," said the countess.

"Hea en only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish.

Still, I will take Boris and go to see him at once, and I shall speak to him straight out.

Let people think what they will of me, it's really all the same to me when my son's fate is at stake." The princess rose. "It's now two o'clock and you dine at four.

There will just be time."

And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time, Anna Mikhaylo na sent someone to call her son, and went into the anteroom with him.

"Good by, my dear," said she to the countess who saw her to the door, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, "Wish me good luck."

"Are you going to Count Cyril  ladimiro ich, my dear?" said the count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added  "If he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us.

He has been to the house, you know, and danced with the children.

Be sure to in ite him, my dear.

We will see how Taras distinguishes himself today.

He says Count Orlo  ne er ga e such a dinner as ours will be!"

CHAPTER X 

"My dear Boris," said Princess Anna Mikhaylo na to her son as Countess Rosto a's carriage in which they were seated dro e o er the straw co ered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril  ladimiro ich Bezukho 's house. "My dear Boris," said the mother, drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her son's arm, "be affectionate and attenti e to him.

Count Cyril  ladimiro ich is your godfather after all, your future depends on him.

Remember that, my dear, and be nice to him, as you so well know how to be."

"If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it..." answered her son coldly. "But I ha e promised and will do it for your sake."

Although the hall porter saw someone's carriage standing at the entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the lady's old cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses, and, hearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency was worse today, and that his excellency was not recei ing anyone.

"We may as well go back," said the son in French.

"My dear!" exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him.

Boris said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking off his cloak.

"My friend," said Anna Mikhaylo na in gentle tones, addressing the hall porter, "I know Count Cyril  ladimiro ich is  ery ill... that's why I ha e come... I am a relation. I shall not disturb him, my friend... I only need see Prince  asili Sergee ich  he is staying here, is he not?

Please announce me."

The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned away.

"Princess Drubetskaya to see Prince  asili Sergee ich," he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow tail coat, who ran downstairs and looked o er from the halfway landing.

The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large  enetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden down shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairs.

"My dear," she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a touch, "you promised me!"

The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.

They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the apartments assigned to Prince  asili.

Just as the mother and son, ha ing reached the middle of the hall, were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince  asili came out     wearing a  el et coat with a single star on his breast, as was his custom when at home     taking lea e of a good looking, dark haired man.

This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.

"Then it is certain?" said the prince.

"Prince, humanum est errare,   but..." replied the doctor, swallowing his r's, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent.

  To err is human. " ery well,  ery well..."

Seeing Anna Mikhaylo na and her son, Prince  asili dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry.

The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his mother's face, and he smiled slightly.

"Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our dear in alid?" said she, as though unaware of the cold offensi e look fixed on her.

Prince  asili stared at her and at Boris questioningly and perplexed.

Boris bowed politely.

Prince  asili without acknowledging the bow turned to Anna Mikhaylo na, answering her query by a mo ement of the head and lips indicating  ery little hope for the patient.

"Is it possible?" exclaimed Anna Mikhaylo na. "Oh, how awful!

It is terrible to think.... This is my son," she added, indicating Boris. "He wanted to thank you himself."

Boris bowed again politely.

"Belie e me, Prince, a mother's heart will ne er forget what you ha e done for us."

"I am glad I was able to do you a ser ice, my dear Anna Mikhaylo na," said Prince  asili, arranging his lace frill, and in tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikhaylo na whom he had placed under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in Petersburg at Anna Scherer's reception.

"Try to ser e well and show yourself worthy," added he, addressing Boris with se erity. "I am glad.... Are you here on lea e?" he went on in his usual tone of indifference.

"I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency," replied Boris, betraying neither annoyance at the prince's brusque manner nor a desire to enter into con ersation, but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince ga e him a searching glance.

"Are you li ing with your mother?"

"I am li ing at Countess Rosto a's," replied Boris, again adding, "your excellency."

"That is, with Ilya Rosto  who married Nataly Shinshina," said Anna Mikhaylo na.

"I know, I know," answered Prince  asili in his monotonous  oice. "I ne er could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear!

A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too, I am told."

"But a  ery kind man, Prince," said Anna Mikhaylo na with a pathetic smile, as though she too knew that Count Rosto  deser ed this censure, but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. "What do the doctors say?" asked the princess after a pause, her worn face again expressing deep sorrow.

"They gi e little hope," replied the prince.

"And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me and Boris.

He is his godson," she added, her tone suggesting that this fact ought to gi e Prince  asili much satisfaction.

Prince  asili became thoughtful and frowned.

Anna Mikhaylo na saw that he was afraid of finding in her a ri al for Count Bezukho 's fortune, and hastened to reassure him.

"If it were not for my sincere affection and de otion to Uncle," said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, "I know his character  noble, upright... but you see he has no one with him except the young princesses.... They are still young...." She bent her head and continued in a whisper  "Has he performed his final duty, Prince?

How priceless are those last moments!

It can make things no worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill.

We women, Prince," and she smiled tenderly, "always know how to say these things.

I absolutely must see him, howe er painful it may be for me. I am used to suffering."

E idently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done at Anna Pa lo na's, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna Mikhaylo na.

"Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna Mikhaylo na?" said he. "Let us wait until e ening. The doctors are expecting a crisis."

"But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment!

Consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake.

Ah, it is awful  the duties of a Christian..."

A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the count's niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs.

Prince  asili turned to her.

"Well, how is he?"

"Still the same  but what can you expect, this noise..." said the princess, looking at Anna Mikhaylo na as at a stranger.

"Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you," said Anna Mikhaylo na with a happy smile, ambling lightly up to the count's niece.

"I ha e come, and am at your ser ice to help you nurse my uncle.

I imagine what you ha e gone through," and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.

The princess ga e no reply and did not e en smile, but left the room as Anna Mikhaylo na took off her glo es and, occupying the position she had conquered, settled down in an armchair, in iting Prince  asili to take a seat beside her.

"Boris," she said to her son with a smile, "I shall go in to see the count, my uncle  but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile and don't forget to gi e him the Rosto s' in itation.

They ask him to dinner.

I suppose he won't go?" she continued, turning to the prince.

"On the contrary," replied the prince, who had plainly become depressed, "I shall be only too glad if you relie e me of that young man....

Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him."

He shrugged his shoulders.

A footman conducted Boris down one flight of stairs and up another, to Pierre's rooms.

CHAPTER X I

Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to Moscow.

The story told about him at Count Rosto 's was true.

Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear.

He had now been for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father's house.

Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father     who were ne er fa orably disposed toward him     would ha e used it to turn the count against him, he ne ertheless on the day of his arri al went to his father's part of the house.

Entering the drawing room, where the princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud.

It was the eldest who was reading     the one who had met Anna Mikhaylo na. The two younger ones were embroidering  both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier.

Pierre was recei ed as if he were a corpse or a leper.

The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes  the second assumed precisely the same expression  while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and li ely disposition, bent o er her frame to hide a smile probably e oked by the amusing scene she foresaw.

She drew her wool down through the can as and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying to make out the pattern.

"How do you do, cousin?" said Pierre.

"You don't recognize me?"

"I recognize you only too well, too well."

"How is the count?

Can I see him?" asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual, but unabashed.

"The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you ha e done your best to increase his mental sufferings."

"Can I see the count?" Pierre again asked.

"Hm....

If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see him...

Olga, go and see whether Uncle's beef tea is ready     it is almost time," she added, gi ing Pierre to understand that they were busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while e idently he, Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.

Olga went out.

Pierre stood looking at the sisters  then he bowed and said 

"Then I will go to my rooms.

You will let me know when I can see him."

And he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole.

Next day Prince  asili had arri ed and settled in the count's house.

He sent for Pierre and said to him 

"My dear fellow, if you are going to beha e here as you did in Petersburg, you will end  ery badly  that is all I ha e to say to you. The count is  ery,  ery ill, and you must not see him at all."

Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs.

When Boris appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room, stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall, as if running a sword through an in isible foe, and glaring sa agely o er his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.

"England is done for," said he, scowling and pointing his finger at someone unseen.

"Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of man, is sentenced to..." But before Pierre     who at that moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to ha e just effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Do er and captured London     could pronounce Pitt's sentence, he saw a well built and handsome young officer entering his room.

Pierre paused.

He had left Moscow when Boris was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but in his usual impulsi e and hearty way he took Boris by the hand with a friendly smile.

"Do you remember me?" asked Boris quietly with a pleasant smile. "I ha e come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not well."

"Yes, it seems he is ill.

People are always disturbing him," answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.

Boris felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.

"Count Rosto  asks you to come to dinner today," said he, after a considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.

"Ah, Count Rosto !" exclaimed Pierre joyfully. "Then you are his son, Ilya?

Only fancy, I didn't know you at first.

Do you remember how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It's such an age..."

"You are mistaken," said Boris deliberately, with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile. "I am Boris, son of Princess Anna Mikhaylo na Drubetskaya.

Rosto , the father, is Ilya, and his son is Nicholas.

I ne er knew any Madame Jacquot."

Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.

"Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I' e mixed e erything up.

One has so many relati es in Moscow!

So you are Boris? Of course.

Well, now we know where we are.

And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition?

The English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the Channel.

I think the expedition is quite feasible.

If only  illeneu e doesn't make a mess of things!"

Boris knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition  he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard  illeneu e's name.

"We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics," said he in his quiet ironical tone. "I know nothing about it and ha e not thought about it.

Moscow is chiefly busy with gossip," he continued. "Just now they are talking about you and your father."

Pierre smiled in his good natured way as if afraid for his companion's sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret.

But Boris spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into Pierre's eyes.

"Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip," Boris went on. "E erybody is wondering to whom the count will lea e his fortune, though he may perhaps outli e us all, as I sincerely hope he will..."

"Yes, it is all  ery horrid," interrupted Pierre, " ery horrid." Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inad ertently say something disconcerting to himself.

"And it must seem to you," said Boris flushing slightly, but not changing his tone or attitude, "it must seem to you that e eryone is trying to get something out of the rich man?"

"So it does," thought Pierre.

"But I just wish to say, to a oid misunderstandings, that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people.

We are  ery poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the  ery reason that your father is rich, I don't regard myself as a relation of his, and neither I nor my mother would e er ask or take anything from him."

For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped up from the sofa, seized Boris under the elbow in his quick, clumsy way, and, blushing far more than Boris, began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and  exation.

"Well, this is strange!

Do you suppose I... who could think?... I know  ery well..."

But Boris again interrupted him.

"I am glad I ha e spoken out fully.

Perhaps you did not like it? You must excuse me," said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him, "but I hope I ha e not offended you.

I always make it a rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take?

Will you come to dinner at the Rosto s'?"

And Boris, ha ing apparently relie ed himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it, became quite pleasant again.

"No, but I say," said Pierre, calming down, "you are a wonderful fellow!

What you ha e just said is good,  ery good.

Of course you don't know me.

We ha e not met for such a long time... not since we were children. You might think that I... I understand, quite understand.

I could not ha e done it myself, I should not ha e had the courage, but it's splendid.

I am  ery glad to ha e made your acquaintance.

It's queer," he added after a pause, "that you should ha e suspected me!" He began to laugh. "Well, what of it!

I hope we'll get better acquainted," and he pressed Boris' hand. "Do you know, I ha e not once been in to see the count.

He has not sent for me.... I am sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?"

"And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?" asked Boris with a smile.

Pierre saw that Boris wished to change the subject, and being of the same mind he began explaining the ad antages and disad antages of the Boulogne expedition.

A footman came in to summon Boris     the princess was going.

Pierre, in order to make Boris' better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner, and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately o er his spectacles into Boris' eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time, no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant, intelligent, and resolute young man.

As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a lonely life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up his mind that they would be friends.

Prince  asili saw the princess off.

She held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful.

"It is dreadful, dreadful!" she was saying, "but cost me what it may I shall do my duty.

I will come and spend the night.

He must not be left like this.

E ery moment is precious.

I can't think why his nieces put it off.

Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him!... Adieu, Prince! May God support you..."

"Adieu, ma bonne," answered Prince  asili turning away from her.

"Oh, he is in a dreadful state," said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage. "He hardly recognizes anybody."

"I don't understand, Mamma     what is his attitude to Pierre?" asked the son.

"The will will show that, my dear  our fate also depends on it."

"But why do you expect that he will lea e us anything?"

"Ah, my dear!

He is so rich, and we are so poor!"

"Well, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma..."

"Oh, Hea en!

How ill he is!" exclaimed the mother.

CHAPTER X II

After Anna Mikhaylo na had dri en off with her son to  isit Count Cyril  ladimiro ich Bezukho , Countess Rosto a sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes.

At last she rang.

"What is the matter with you, my dear?" she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes. "Don't you wish to ser e me?

Then I'll find you another place."

The countess was upset by her friend's sorrow and humiliating po erty, and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid "my dear" and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness.

"I am  ery sorry, ma'am," answered the maid.

"Ask the count to come to me."

The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as usual.

"Well, little countess?

What a saute of game au madere we are to ha e, my dear!

I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for Taras were not ill spent.

He is worth it!"

He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his gray hair.

"What are your commands, little countess?"

"You see, my dear... What's that mess?" she said, pointing to his waistcoat. "It's the saute, most likely," she added with a smile. "Well, you see, Count, I want some money."

Her face became sad.

"Oh, little countess!"... and the count began bustling to get out his pocketbook.

"I want a great deal, Count! I want fi e hundred rubles," and taking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband's waistcoat.

"Yes, immediately, immediately!

Hey, who's there?" he called out in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to obey the summons. "Send Dmitri to me!"

Dmitri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the count's house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room.

"This is what I want, my dear fellow," said the count to the deferential young man who had entered. "Bring me..." he reflected a moment, "yes, bring me se en hundred rubles, yes!

But mind, don't bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones for the countess."

"Yes, Dmitri, clean ones, please," said the countess, sighing deeply.

"When would you like them, your excellency?" asked Dmitri. "Allow me to inform you... But, don't be uneasy," he added, noticing that the count was beginning to breathe hea ily and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger. "I was forgetting... Do you wish it brought at once?"

"Yes, yes  just so! Bring it.

Gi e it to the countess."

"What a treasure that Dmitri is," added the count with a smile when the young man had departed. "There is ne er any 'impossible' with him.

That's a thing I hate!

E erything is possible."

"Ah, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world," said the countess. "But I am in great need of this sum."

"You, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift," said the count, and ha ing kissed his wife's hand he went back to his study.

When Anna Mikhaylo na returned from Count Bezukho 's the money, all in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess' little table, and Anna Mikhaylo na noticed that something was agitating her.

"Well, my dear?" asked the countess.

"Oh, what a terrible state he is in!

One would not know him, he is so ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word..."

"Annette, for hea en's sake don't refuse me," the countess began, with a blush that looked  ery strange on her thin, dignified, elderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief.

Anna Mikhaylo na instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.

"This is for Boris from me, for his outfit."

Anna Mikhaylo na was already embracing her and weeping.

The countess wept too.

They wept because they were friends, and because they were kindhearted, and because they     friends from childhood     had to think about such a base thing as money, and because their youth was o er.... But those tears were pleasant to them both.

CHAPTER X III

Countess Rosto a, with her daughters and a large number of guests, was already seated in the drawing room.

The count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes.

From time to time he went out to ask  "Hasn't she come yet?"

They were expecting Marya Dmitrie na Akhrosimo a, known in society as le terrible dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for common sense and frank plainness of speech.

Marya Dmitrie na was known to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both cities wondered at her, laughed pri ately at her rudenesses, and told good stories about her, while none the less all without exception respected and feared her.

In the count's room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked of war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the recruiting.

None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew it had appeared.

The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and talking.

He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with e ident pleasure and listened to the con ersation of his two neighbors, whom he egged on against each other.

One of them was a sallow, clean sha en ci ilian with a thin and wrinkled face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and, ha ing stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes.

This was an old bachelor, Shinshin, a cousin of the countess', a man with "a sharp tongue" as they said in Moscow society.

He seemed to be condescending to his companion.

The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards, irreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings.

This was Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Semeno  regiment with whom Boris was to tra el to join the army, and about whom Natasha had, teased her elder sister  era, speaking of Berg as her "intended."

The count sat between them and listened attenti ely.

His fa orite occupation when not playing boston, a card game he was  ery fond of, was that of listener, especially when he succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another.

"Well, then, old chap, mon tres honorable Alphonse Karlo ich," said Shinshin, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian expressions with the choicest French phrases     which was a peculiarity of his speech. " ous comptez  ous faire des rentes sur l'etat    you want to make something out of your company?"   You expect to make an income out of the go ernment.

"No, Peter Nikolae ich  I only want to show that in the ca alry the ad antages are far less than in the infantry.

Just consider my own position now, Peter Nikolae ich..."

Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision.

His con ersation always related entirely to himself  he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself.

He could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as soon as the con ersation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with e ident satisfaction.

"Consider my position, Peter Nikolae ich. Were I in the ca alry I should get not more than two hundred rubles e ery four months, e en with the rank of lieutenant  but as it is I recei e two hundred and thirty," said he, looking at Shinshin and the count with a joyful, pleasant smile, as if it were ob ious to him that his success must always be the chief desire of e eryone else.

"Besides that, Peter Nikolae ich, by exchanging into the Guards I shall be in a more prominent position," continued Berg, "and  acancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards.

Then just think what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles!

I e en manage to put a little aside and to send something to my father," he went on, emitting a smoke ring.

"La balance y est...   A German knows how to skin a flint, as the pro erb says," remarked Shinshin, mo ing his pipe to the other side of his mouth and winking at the count.   So that squares matters.

The count burst out laughing.

The other guests seeing that Shinshin was talking came up to listen.

Berg, obli ious of irony or indifference, continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps  how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company, might easily succeed to the post  how popular he was with e eryone in the regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him.

Berg e idently enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others, too, might ha e their own interests.

But all he said was so prettily sedate, and the nai ete of his youthful egotism was so ob ious, that he disarmed his hearers.

"Well, my boy, you'll get along where er you go     foot or horse     that I'll warrant," said Shinshin, patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa.

Berg smiled joyously.

The count, by his guests, went into the drawing room.

It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests, expecting the summons to zakuska,   a oid engaging in any long con ersation but think it necessary to mo e about and talk, in order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food.

The host and hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at one another, and the  isitors try to guess from these glances who, or what, they are waiting for     some important relation who has not yet arri ed, or a dish that is not yet ready.   Hors d'oeu res.

Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across, blocking the way for e eryone.

The countess tried to make him talk, but he went on nai ely looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables.

He was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact.

Most of the guests, knowing of the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity at this big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest fellow could ha e played such a prank on a policeman.

"You ha e only lately arri ed?" the countess asked him.

"Oui, madame," replied he, looking around him.

"You ha e not yet seen my husband?"

"Non, madame." He smiled quite inappropriately.

"You ha e been in Paris recently, I belie e?

I suppose it's  ery interesting."

" ery interesting."

The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhaylo na.

The latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father  but he answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables.

The other guests were all con ersing with one another.

"The Razumo skis... It was charming... You are  ery kind... Countess Apraksina..." was heard on all sides.

The countess rose and went into the ballroom.

"Marya Dmitrie na?" came her  oice from there.

"Herself," came the answer in a rough  oice, and Marya Dmitrie na entered the room.

All the unmarried ladies and e en the married ones except the  ery oldest rose.

Marya Dmitrie na paused at the door. Tall and stout, holding high her fifty year old head with its gray curls, she stood sur eying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide slee es as if rolling them up.

Marya Dmitrie na always spoke in Russian.

"Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her children," she said, in her loud, full toned  oice which drowned all others. "Well, you old sinner," she went on, turning to the count who was kissing her hand, "you're feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay?

Nowhere to hunt with your dogs?

But what is to be done, old man? Just see how these nestlings are growing up," and she pointed to the girls. "You must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not...."

"Well," said she, "how's my Cossack?" (Marya Dmitrie na always called Natasha a Cossack) and she stroked the child's arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand. "I know she's a scamp of a girl, but I like her."

She took a pair of pear shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and, ha ing gi en them to the rosy Natasha, who beamed with the pleasure of her saint's day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to Pierre.

"Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit," said she, assuming a soft high tone of  oice. "Come here, my friend..." and she ominously tucked up her slee es still higher.

Pierre approached, looking at her in a childlike way through his spectacles.

"Come nearer, come nearer, friend!

I used to be the only one to tell your father the truth when he was in fa or, and in your case it's my e ident duty."

She paused.

All were silent, expectant of what was to follow, for this was dearly only a prelude.

"A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear!

For shame, sir, for shame!

It would be better if you went to the war."

She turned away and ga e her hand to the count, who could hardly keep from laughing.

"Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?" said Marya Dmitrie na.

The count went in first with Marya Dmitrie na, the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment  then came Anna Mikhaylo na with Shinshin.

Berg ga e his arm to  era.

The smiling Julie Karagina went in with Nicholas.

After them other couples followed, filling the whole dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and go ernesses followed singly.

The footmen began mo ing about, chairs scraped, the band struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their places.

Then the strains of the count's household band were replaced by the clatter of kni es and forks, the  oices of  isitors, and the soft steps of the footmen.

At one end of the table sat the countess with Marya Dmitrie na on her right and Anna Mikhaylo na on her left, the other lady  isitors were farther down.

At the other end sat the count, with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshin and the other male  isitors on his right.

Midway down the long table on one side sat the grownup young people   era beside Berg, and Pierre beside Boris  and on the other side, the children, tutors, and go ernesses.

From behind the crystal decanters and fruit  ases the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its light blue ribbons, and busily filled his neighbors' glasses, not neglecting his own.

The countess in turn, without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair.

At the ladies' end an e en chatter of  oices was heard all the time, at the men's end the  oices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the colonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests.

Berg with tender smiles was saying to  era that lo e is not an earthly but a hea enly feeling.

Boris was telling his new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with Natasha, who was sitting opposite.

Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a great deal.

Of the two soups he chose turtle with sa ory patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines. These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a napkin, from behind the next man's shoulders and whispered  "Dry Madeira"... "Hungarian"... or "Rhine wine" as the case might be.

Of the four crystal glasses engra ed with the count's monogram that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment, gazing with e er increasing amiability at the other guests.

Natasha, who sat opposite, was looking at Boris as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in lo e with and ha e just kissed for the first time.

Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny li ely little girl's look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why.

Nicholas sat at some distance from Sonya, beside Julie Karagina, to whom he was again talking with the same in oluntary smile.

Sonya wore a company smile but was e idently tormented by jealousy  now she turned pale, now blushed and strained e ery ner e to o erhear what Nicholas and Julie were saying to one another.

The go erness kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children.

The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines, and kinds of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people in Germany  and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by.

He frowned, trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge.

CHAPTER XIX

At the men's end of the table the talk grew more and more animated.

The colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief.

"And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?" remarked Shinshin.

"He has stopped Austria's cackle and I fear it will be our turn next."

The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, e idently de oted to the ser ice and patriotically Russian.

He resented Shinshin's remark.

"It is for the reasson, my goot sir," said he, speaking with a German accent, "for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat.

He declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger  reatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as  ell as ze sanctity of its alliances..." he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter.

Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto  ... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor's sole and absolute aim     to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations     has now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the attainment of that purpose.

"Zat, my dear sir, is  y..." he concluded, drinking a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for appro al.

"Connaissez  ous le Pro erbe   

'Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but turn spindles at home!'?" said Shinshin, puckering his brows and smiling. "Cela nous con ient a mer eille. (2) Su oro  now     he knew what he was about  yet they beat him a plate couture, (3) and where are we to find Su oro s now?

Je  ous demande un peu," (4) said he, continually changing from French to Russian.

 Do you know the pro erb?  (2) That suits us down to the ground.  (3) Hollow.  (4) I just ask you that. " e must  ight to the last tr r op of our plood!" said the colonel, thumping the table  "and  e must tie for our Emperor, and zen all  ill pe  ell.

And  e must discuss it as little as po o ossible"... he dwelt particularly on the word possible... "as po o ossible," he ended, again turning to the count. "Zat is how  e old hussars look at it, and zere's an end of it!

And how do you, a young man and a young hussar, how do you judge of it?" he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel.

"I am quite of your opinion," replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning his plate round and mo ing his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger. "I am con inced that we Russians must die or conquer," he concluded, conscious     as were others     after the words were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore awkward.

"What you said just now was splendid!" said his partner Julie.

Sonya trembled all o er and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.

Pierre listened to the colonel's speech and nodded appro ingly.

"That's fine," said he.

"The young man's a real hussar!" shouted the colonel, again thumping the table.

"What are you making such a noise about o er there?" Marya Dmitrie na's deep  oice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table. "What are you thumping the table for?" she demanded of the hussar, "and why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French are here?"

"I am speaking ze truce," replied the hussar with a smile.

"It's all about the war," the count shouted down the table. "You know my son's going, Marya Dmitrie na? My son is going."

"I ha e four sons in the army but still I don't fret.

It is all in God's hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle," replied Marya Dmitrie na's deep  oice, which easily carried the whole length of the table.

"That's true!"

Once more the con ersations concentrated, the ladies' at the one end and the men's at the other.

"You won't ask," Natasha's little brother was saying  "I know you won't ask!"

"I will," replied Natasha.

Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution.

She half rose, by a glance in iting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what was coming, and turning to her mother 

"Mamma!" rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish  oice, audible the whole length of the table.

"What is it?" asked the countess, startled  but seeing by her daughter's face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding mo ement of her head.

The con ersation was hushed.

"Mamma! What sweets are we going to ha e?" and Natasha's  oice sounded still more firm and resolute.

The countess tried to frown, but could not.

Marya Dmitrie na shook her fat finger.

"Cossack!" she said threateningly.

Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the elders.

"You had better take care!" said the countess.

"Mamma! What sweets are we going to ha e?" Natasha again cried boldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken in good part.

Sonya and fat little Petya doubled up with laughter.

"You see! I ha e asked," whispered Natasha to her little brother and to Pierre, glancing at him again.

"Ice pudding, but you won't get any," said Marya Dmitrie na.

Natasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she bra ed e en Marya Dmitrie na.

"Marya Dmitrie na! What kind of ice pudding?

I don't like ice cream."

"Carrot ices."

"No! What kind, Marya Dmitrie na? What kind?" she almost screamed  "I want to know!"

Marya Dmitrie na and the countess burst out laughing, and all the guests joined in.

E eryone laughed, not at Marya Dmitrie na's answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat Marya Dmitrie na in this fashion.

Natasha only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice.

Before the ices, champagne was ser ed round.

The band again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, lea ing their seats, went up to "congratulate" the countess, and reached across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and with one another.

Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces, the guests returned to the drawing room and to the count's study.

CHAPTER XX

The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the count's  isitors settled themsel es, some in the two drawing rooms, some in the sitting room, some in the library.

The count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from dropping into his usual after dinner nap, and laughed at e erything.

The young people, at the countess' instigation, gathered round the cla ichord and harp.

Julie by general request played first. After she had played a little air with  ariations on the harp, she joined the other young ladies in begging Natasha and Nicholas, who were noted for their musical talent, to sing something.

Natasha, who was treated as though she were grown up, was e idently  ery proud of this but at the same time felt shy.

"What shall we sing?" she said.

"'The Brook,'" suggested Nicholas.

"Well, then, let's be quick.

Boris, come here," said Natasha. "But where is Sonya?"

She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to look for her.

Running into Sonya's room and not finding her there, Natasha ran to the nursery, but Sonya was not there either.

Natasha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passage.

The chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the Rosto  household.

And there in fact was Sonya lying face downward on Nurse's dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing so con ulsi ely that her bare little shoulders shook.

Natasha's face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saint's day, suddenly changed  her eyes became fixed, and then a shi er passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped.

"Sonya! What is it? What is the matter?...

Oo... Oo... Oo...!"

And Natasha's large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she began to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that Sonya was crying.

Sonya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and hid her face still deeper in the bed.

Natasha wept, sitting on the blue striped feather bed and hugging her friend.

With an effort Sonya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining.

"Nicholas is going away in a week's time, his... papers... ha e come... he told me himself... but still I should not cry," and she showed a paper she held in her hand     with the  erses Nicholas had written, "still, I should not cry, but you can't... no one can understand... what a soul he has!"

And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.

"It's all  ery well for you... I am not en ious... I lo e you and Boris also," she went on, gaining a little strength  "he is nice... there are no difficulties in your way....

But Nicholas is my cousin... one would ha e to... the Metropolitan himself... and e en then it can't be done.

And besides, if she tells Mamma" (Sonya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her so) "that I am spoiling Nicholas' career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God is my witness," and she made the sign of the cross, "I lo e her so much, and all of you, only  era... And what for?

What ha e I done to her?

I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice e erything, only I ha e nothing...."

Sonya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in the feather bed.

Natasha began consoling her, but her face showed that she understood all the gra ity of her friend's trouble.

"Sonya," she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true reason of her friend's sorrow, "I'm sure  era has said something to you since dinner?

Hasn't she?"

"Yes, these  erses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others, and she found them on my table and said she'd show them to Mamma, and that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would ne er allow him to marry me, but that he'll marry Julie.

You see how he's been with her all day... Natasha, what ha e I done to deser e it?..."

And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before.

Natasha lifted her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting her.

"Sonya, don't belie e her, darling! Don't belie e her!

Do you remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting room after supper?

Why, we settled how e erything was to be.

I don't quite remember how, but don't you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was?

There's Uncle Shinshin's brother has married his first cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know.

And Boris says it is quite possible.

You know I ha e told him all about it.

And he is so cle er and so good!" said Natasha. "Don't you cry, Sonya, dear lo e, darling Sonya!" and she kissed her and laughed. " era's spiteful  ne er mind her!

And all will come right and she won't say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself, and he doesn't care at all for Julie."

Natasha kissed her on the hair.

Sonya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.

"Do you think so?...

Really?

Truly?" she said, quickly smoothing her frock and hair.

"Really, truly!" answered Natasha, pushing in a crisp lock that had strayed from under her friend's plaits.

Both laughed.

"Well, let's go and sing

'The Brook.'"

"Come along!"

"Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!" said Natasha, stopping suddenly. "I feel so happy!"

And she set off at a run along the passage.

Sonya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the  erses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran after Natasha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light, joyous steps.

At the  isitors' request the young people sang the quartette,

"The Brook," with which e eryone was delighted. Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned 

At nighttime in the moon's fair glow

How sweet, as fancies wander free,

To feel that in this world there's one

Who still is thinking but of thee!

That while her fingers touch the harp

Wafting sweet music o'er the lea,

It is for thee thus swells her heart,

Sighing its message out to thee...

A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,

But oh! till then I cannot li e!...

He had not finished the last  erse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.

Pierre was sitting in the drawing room where Shinshin had engaged him, as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political con ersation in which se eral others joined but which bored Pierre.

When the music began Natasha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said, laughing and blushing 

"Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers."

"I am afraid of mixing the figures," Pierre replied  "but if you will be my teacher..."

And lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl.

While the couples were arranging themsel es and the musicians tuning up, Pierre sat down with his little partner.

Natasha was perfectly happy  she was dancing with a grown up man, who had been abroad.

She was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown up lady.

She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had gi en her to hold.

Assuming quite the pose of a society woman (hea en knows when and where she had learned it) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and smiling o er the fan.

"Dear, dear!

Just look at her!" exclaimed the countess as she crossed the ballroom, pointing to Natasha.

Natasha blushed and laughed.

"Well, really, Mamma!

Why should you?

What is there to be surprised at?"

In the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Marya Dmitrie na had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older  isitors. They now, stretching themsel es after sitting so long, and replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom.

First came Marya Dmitrie na and the count, both with merry countenances.

The count, with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his bent arm to Marya Dmitrie na.

He drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery, addressing the first  iolin 

"Semen!

Do you know the Daniel Cooper?"

This was the count's fa orite dance, which he had danced in his youth. (Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.)

"Look at Papa!" shouted Natasha to the whole company, and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a grown up partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.

And indeed e erybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jo ial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner, Marya Dmitrie na, cur ed his arms, beat time, straightened his shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the onlookers for what was to follow.

As soon as the pro ocati ely gay strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs     the men on one side and the women on the other     who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry.

"Just look at the master!

A regular eagle he is!" loudly remarked the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.

The count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not want to dance well.

Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance.

What was expressed by the whole of the count's plump figure, in Marya Dmitrie na found expression only in her more and more beaming face and qui ering nose.

But if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneu ers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet, Marya Dmitrie na produced no less impression by slight exertions     the least effort to mo e her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp her foot     which e eryone appreciated in  iew of her size and habitual se erity.

The dance grew li elier and li elier.

The other couples could not attract a moment's attention to their own e olutions and did not e en try to do so.

All were watching the count and Marya Dmitrie na.

Natasha kept pulling e eryone by slee e or dress, urging them to "look at Papa!" though as it was they ne er took their eyes off the couple.

In the inter als of the dance the count, breathing deeply, wa ed and shouted to the musicians to play faster.

Faster, faster, and faster  lightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying round Marya Dmitrie na, now on his toes, now on his heels  until, turning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas, raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by Natasha.

Both partners stood still, breathing hea ily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.

"That's how we used to dance in our time, ma chere," said the count.

"That was a Daniel Cooper!" exclaimed Marya Dmitrie na, tucking up her slee es and puffing hea ily.

CHAPTER XXI

While in the Rosto s' ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced, to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper, Count Bezukho  had a sixth stroke.

The doctors pronounced reco ery impossible. After a mute confession, communion was administered to the dying man, preparations made for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments.

Outside the house, beyond the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid whene er a carriage dro e up, waited in expectation of an important order for an expensi e funeral.

The Military Go ernor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending aides de camp to inquire after the count's health, came himself that e ening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of Catherine's court, Count Bezukho .

The magnificent reception room was crowded.

E eryone stood up respectfully when the Military Go ernor, ha ing stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed on him by the doctors, clergy, and relati es of the family.

Prince  asili, who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days, escorted him to the door, repeating something to him se eral times in low tones.

When the Military Go ernor had gone, Prince  asili sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high o er the other, leaning his elbow on his knee and co ering his face with his hand.

After sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him with frightened eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of the house, to the room of the eldest princess.

Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in ner ous whispers, and, whene er anyone went into or came from the dying man's room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door, which creaked slightly when opened.

"The limits of human life... are fixed and may not be o'erpassed," said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening nai ely to his words.

"I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?" asked the lady, adding the priest's clerical title, as if she had no opinion of her own on the subject.

"Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament," replied the priest, passing his hand o er the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head.

"Who was that? The Military Go ernor himself?" was being asked at the other side of the room. "How young looking he is!"

"Yes, and he is o er sixty.

I hear the count no longer recognizes anyone.

They wished to administer the sacrament of unction."

"I knew someone who recei ed that sacrament se en times."

The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a table.

"Beautiful," said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather. "The weather is beautiful, Princess  and besides, in Moscow one feels as if one were in the country."

"Yes, indeed," replied the princess with a sigh. "So he may ha e something to drink?"

Lorrain considered.

"Has he taken his medicine?"

"Yes."

The doctor glanced at his watch.

"Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar," and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.

"Dere has neffer been a gase," a German doctor was saying to an aide de camp, "dat one liffs after de sird stroke."

"And what a well preser ed man he was!" remarked the aide de camp. "And who will inherit his wealth?" he added in a whisper.

"It  on't go begging," replied the German with a smile.

E eryone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to Lorrain's instructions.

The German doctor went up to Lorrain.

"Do you think he can last till morning?" asked the German, addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.

Lorrain, pursing up his lips, wa ed a se erely negati e finger before his nose.

"Tonight, not later," said he in a low  oice, and he mo ed away with a decorous smile of self satisfaction at being able clearly to understand and state the patient's condition.

Meanwhile Prince  asili had opened the door into the princess' room.

In this room it was almost dark  only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles.

The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots, cupboards, and little tables.

The quilt of a high, white feather bed was just  isible behind a screen.

A small dog began to bark.

"Ah, is it you, cousin?"

She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and co ered with  arnish.

"Has anything happened?" she asked. "I am so terrified."

"No, there is no change. I only came to ha e a talk about business, Catiche,"   muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair she had just  acated. "You ha e made the place warm, I must say," he remarked. "Well, sit down  let's ha e a talk."  Catherine.

"I thought perhaps something had happened," she said with her unchanging stonily se ere expression  and, sitting down opposite the prince, she prepared to listen.

"I wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I can't."

"Well, my dear?" said Prince  asili, taking her hand and bending it downwards as was his habit.

It was plain that this "well?" referred to much that they both understood without naming.

The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her legs, looked directly at Prince  asili with no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes.

Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons with a sigh.

This might ha e been taken as an expression of sorrow and de otion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long.

Prince  asili understood it as an expression of weariness.

"And I?" he said  "do you think it is easier for me?

I am as worn out as a post horse, but still I must ha e a talk with you, Catiche, a  ery serious talk."

Prince  asili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch ner ously, now on one side, now on the other, gi ing his face an unpleasant expression which was ne er to be seen on it in a drawing room.

His eyes too seemed strange  at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced round in alarm.

The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands, looked attenti ely into Prince  asili's eyes e idently resol ed not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till morning.

"Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Semeno na," continued Prince  asili, returning to his theme, apparently not without an inner struggle  "at such a moment as this one must think of e erything.

One must think of the future, of all of you... I lo e you all, like children of my own, as you know."

The princess continued to look at him without mo ing, and with the same dull expression.

"And then of course my family has also to be considered," Prince  asili went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at her. "You know, Catiche, that we     you three sisters, Mamonto , and my wife     are the count's only direct heirs.

I know, I know how hard it is for you to talk or think of such matters.

It is no easier for me  but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything.

Do you know I ha e sent for Pierre? The count," pointing to his portrait, "definitely demanded that he should be called."

Prince  asili looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was simply looking at him.

"There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin," she replied, "and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow his noble soul peacefully to lea e this..."

"Yes, yes, of course," interrupted Prince  asili impatiently, rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had pushed away. "But... in short, the fact is... you know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre."

"He has made wills enough!" quietly remarked the princess. "But he cannot lea e the estate to Pierre.

Pierre is illegitimate."

"But, my dear," said Prince  asili suddenly, clutching the little table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly  "what if a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for Pierre's legitimation?

Do you understand that in consideration of the count's ser ices, his request would be granted?..."

The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the subject under discussion than those they are talking with.

"I can tell you more," continued Prince  asili, seizing her hand, "that letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew of it.

The only question is, has it been destroyed or not?

If not, then as soon as all is o er," and Prince  asili sighed to intimate what he meant by the words all is o er, "and the count's papers are opened, the will and letter will be deli ered to the Emperor, and the petition will certainly be granted.

Pierre will get e erything as the legitimate son."

"And our share?" asked the princess smiling ironically, as if anything might happen, only not that.

"But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the legal heir to e erything and you won't get anything.

You must know, my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they ha e been destroyed or not.

And if they ha e somehow been o erlooked, you ought to know where they are, and must find them, because..."

"What next?" the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not changing the expression of her eyes. "I am a woman, and you think we are all stupid  but I know this  an illegitimate son cannot inherit... un batard!"   she added, as if supposing that this translation of the word would effecti ely pro e to Prince  asili the in alidity of his contention.   A bastard.

"Well, really, Catiche! Can't you understand!

You are so intelligent, how is it you don't see that if the count has written a letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count Bezukho , and will then inherit e erything under the will?

And if the will and letter are not destroyed, then you will ha e nothing but the consolation of ha ing been dutiful et tout ce qui s'ensuit!   That's certain."

  And all that follows therefrom.

"I know the will was made, but I also know that it is in alid  and you, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool," said the princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something witty and stinging.

"My dear Princess Catherine Semeno na," began Prince  asili impatiently, "I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about your interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation.

And I tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the will in Pierre's fa or are among the count's papers, then, my dear girl, you and your sisters are not heiresses!

If you don't belie e me, then belie e an expert. I ha e just been talking to Dmitri Onufrich" (the family solicitor) "and he says the same."

At this a sudden change e idently took place in the princess' ideas  her thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her  oice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself e idently did not expect.

"That would be a fine thing!" said she. "I ne er wanted anything and I don't now."

She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.

"And this is gratitude     this is recognition for those who ha e sacrificed e erything for his sake!" she cried. "It's splendid!

Fine!

I don't want anything, Prince."

"Yes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters..." replied Prince  asili.

But the princess did not listen to him.

"Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could expect nothing but meanness, deceit, en y, intrigue, and ingratitude     the blackest ingratitude     in this house..."

"Do you or do you not know where that will is?" insisted Prince  asili, his cheeks twitching more than e er.

"Yes, I was a fool! I still belie ed in people, lo ed them, and sacrificed myself.

But only the base, the  ile succeed!

I know who has been intriguing!"

The princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand.

She had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race. She ga e her companion an angry glance.

"There is still time, my dear.

You must remember, Catiche, that it was all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards forgotten.

Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who..."

"Who sacrificed e erything for him," chimed in the princess, who would again ha e risen had not the prince still held her fast, "though he ne er could appreciate it.

No, mon cousin," she added with a sigh, "I shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward, that in this world there is neither honor nor justice.

In this world one has to be cunning and cruel."

"Now come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart."

"No, I ha e a wicked heart."

"I know your heart," repeated the prince. "I  alue your friendship and wish you to ha e as good an opinion of me.

Don't upset yourself, and let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it but an hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and abo e all where it is. You must know.

We will take it at once and show it to the count.

He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it.

You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes  that is my only reason for being here.

I came simply to help him and you."

"Now I see it all!

I know who has been intriguing     I know!" cried the princess.

"That's not the point, my dear."

"It's that protege of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetskaya, that Anna Mikhaylo na whom I would not take for a housemaid... the infamous,  ile woman!"

"Do not let us lose any time..."

"Ah, don't talk to me!

Last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such  ile, disgraceful things about us, especially about Sophie     I can't repeat them     that it made the count quite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight.

I know it was then he wrote this  ile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was in alid."

"We' e got to it at last     why did you not tell me about it sooner?"

"It's in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow," said the princess, ignoring his question.

"Now I know! Yes  if I ha e a sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that  ile woman!" almost shrieked the princess, now quite changed. "And what does she come worming herself in here for?

But I will gi e her a piece of my mind.

The time will come!"

CHAPTER XXII

While these con ersations were going on in the reception room and the princess' room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for) and Anna Mikhaylo na (who found it necessary to accompany him) was dri ing into the court of Count Bezukho 's house.

As the wheels rolled softly o er the straw beneath the windows, Anna Mikhaylo na, ha ing turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up.

Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna Mikhaylo na out of the carriage, and only then began to think of the inter iew with his dying father which awaited him.

He noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door.

While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall.

Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed se eral other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides.

But neither Anna Mikhaylo na nor the footman nor the coachman, who could not help seeing these people, took any notice of them.

"It seems to be all right," Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikhaylo na.

She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow. Though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikhaylo na's air of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary.

Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked o er by some men who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots clattering.

These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikhaylo na pass and did not e ince the least surprise at seeing them there.

"Is this the way to the princesses' apartments?" asked Anna Mikhaylo na of one of them.

"Yes," replied a footman in a bold loud  oice, as if anything were now permissible  "the door to the left, ma'am."

"Perhaps the count did not ask for me," said Pierre when he reached the landing. "I'd better go to my own room."

Anna Mikhaylo na paused and waited for him to come up.

"Ah, my friend!" she said, touching his arm as she had done her son's when speaking to him that afternoon, "belie e me I suffer no less than you do, but be a man!"

"But really, hadn't I better go away?" he asked, looking kindly at her o er his spectacles.

"Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may ha e been done you. Think that he is your father... perhaps in the agony of death." She sighed.

"I ha e lo ed you like a son from the first.

Trust yourself to me, Pierre.

I shall not forget your interests."

Pierre did not understand a word, but the con iction that all this had to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna Mikhaylo na who was already opening a door.

This door led into a back anteroom.

An old man, a ser ant of the princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking.

Pierre had ne er been in this part of the house and did not e en know of the existence of these rooms.

Anna Mikhaylo na, addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as "my dear" and "my sweet," asked about the princess' health and then led Pierre along a stone passage.

The first door on the left led into the princesses' apartments.

The maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (e erything in the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna Mikhaylo na in passing instincti ely glanced into the room, where Prince  asili and the eldest princess were sitting close together talking.

Seeing them pass, Prince  asili drew back with ob ious impatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might.

This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on Prince  asili's face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly o er his spectacles at his guide.

Anna Mikhaylo na e inced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as if to say that this was no more than she had expected.

"Be a man, my friend. I will look after your interests," said she in reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage.

Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what "watching o er his interests" meant, but he decided that all these things had to be.

From the passage they went into a large, dimly lit room adjoining the count's reception room.

It was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach, but e en in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water had been spilled on the carpet.

They were met by a deacon with a censer and by a ser ant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them.

They went into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian windows opening into the conser atory, with its large bust and full length portrait of Catherine the Great.

The same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one another.

All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear worn Anna Mikhaylo na as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre who, hanging his head, meekly followed her.

Anna Mikhaylo na's face expressed a consciousness that the decisi e moment had arri ed. With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now, keeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room e en more boldly than that afternoon.

She felt that as she brought with her the person the dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured.

Casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the count's confessor there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully recei ed the blessing first of one and then of another priest.

"God be thanked that you are in time," said she to one of the priests  "all we relati es ha e been in such anxiety.

This young man is the count's son," she added more softly. "What a terrible moment!"

Ha ing said this she went up to the doctor.

"Dear doctor," said she, "this young man is the count's son. Is there any hope?"

The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his shoulders.

Anna Mikhaylo na with just the same mo ement raised her shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and mo ed away from the doctor to Pierre.

To him, in a particularly respectful and tenderly sad  oice, she said 

"Trust in His mercy!" and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and wait for her, she went silently toward the door that e eryone was watching and it creaked  ery slightly as she disappeared behind it.

Pierre, ha ing made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, mo ed toward the sofa she had indicated.

As soon as Anna Mikhaylo na had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy.

He noticed that they whispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and e en ser ility.

A deference such as he had ne er before recei ed was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to the priests, rose and offered him her seat  an aide de camp picked up and returned a glo e Pierre had dropped  the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by, and mo ed to make way for him.

At first Pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to pick up the glo e himself and to pass round the doctors who were not e en in his way  but all at once he felt that this would not do, and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which e eryone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound to accept their ser ices.

He took the glo e in silence from the aide de camp, and sat down in the lady's chair, placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the nai e attitude of an Egyptian statue, and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him.

Not two minutes had passed before Prince  asili with head erect majestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three stars on his breast.

He seemed to ha e grown thinner since the morning  his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed Pierre.

He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he ne er used to do), and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on. "Courage, courage, my friend!

He has asked to see you.

That is well!" and he turned to go.

But Pierre thought it necessary to ask 

"How is..." and hesitated, not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man "the count," yet ashamed to call him "father."

"He had another stroke about half an hour ago.

Courage, my friend..."

Pierre's mind was in such a confused state that the word "stroke" suggested to him a blow from something.

He looked at Prince  asili in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness.

Prince  asili said something to Lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe.

He could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step.

The eldest princess followed him, and the priests and deacons and some ser ants also went in at the door.

Through that door was heard a noise of things being mo ed about, and at last Anna Mikhaylo na, still with the same expression, pale but resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly on the arm said 

"The di ine mercy is inexhaustible!

Unction is about to be administered. Come."

Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed that the strange lady, the aide de camp, and some of the ser ants, all followed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that room.

CHAPTER XXIII

Pierre well knew this large room di ided by columns and an arch, its walls hung round with Persian carpets.

The part of the room behind the columns, with a high silk curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated with red light like a Russian church during e ening ser ice.

Under the gleaming icons stood a long in alid chair, and in that chair on snowy white smooth pillows, e idently freshly changed, Pierre saw     co ered to the waist by a bright green quilt     the familiar, majestic figure of his father, Count Bezukho , with that gray mane of hair abo e his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion, and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face.

He lay just under the icons  his large thick hands outside the quilt.

Into the right hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb, and an old ser ant, bending o er from behind the chair, held it in position.

By the chair stood the priests, their long hair falling o er their magnificent glittering  estments, with lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the ser ice.

A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of them their eldest sister, Catiche, with a  icious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons, as though declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance round.

Anna Mikhaylo na, with a meek, sorrowful, and all forgi ing expression on her face, stood by the door near the strange lady.

Prince  asili in front of the door, near the in alid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on the car ed back of a  el et chair he had turned round for the purpose, and was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead.

His face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of God.

"If you do not understand these sentiments," he seemed to be saying, "so much the worse for you!"

Behind him stood the aide de camp, the doctors, and the menser ants  the men and women had separated as in church.

All were silently crossing themsel es, and the reading of the church ser ice, the subdued chanting of deep bass  oices, and in the inter als sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard.

Anna Mikhaylo na, with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about, went across the room to where Pierre was standing and ga e him a taper.

He lit it and, distracted by obser ing those around him, began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper.

Sophie, the rosy, laughter lo ing, youngest princess with the mole, watched him.

She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained with it hidden for awhile  then looking up and seeing Pierre she again began to laugh.

She e idently felt unable to look at him without laughing, but could not resist looking at him  so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns.

In the midst of the ser ice the  oices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered to one another, and the old ser ant who was holding the count's hand got up and said something to the ladies.

Anna Mikhaylo na stepped forward and, stooping o er the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from behind her back.

The French doctor held no taper  he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he, a foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith, understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and e en appro ed of it. He now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full  igor of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment.

The sick man was gi en something to drink, there was a stir around him, then the people resumed their places and the ser ice continued.

During this inter al Pierre noticed that Prince  asili left the chair on which he had been leaning, and     with an air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for them     did not go up to the dying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and mo ed with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings.

On lea ing the bed both Prince  asili and the princess passed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the other before the ser ice was concluded.

Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, ha ing made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that e ening was in some way essential.

The chanting of the ser ice ceased, and the  oice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on ha ing recei ed the sacrament.

The dying man lay as lifeless and immo able as before.

Around him e eryone began to stir  steps were audible and whispers, among which Anna Mikhaylo na's was the most distinct.

Pierre heard her say 

"Certainly he must be mo ed onto the bed  here it will be impossible..."

The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and ser ants that Pierre could no longer see the reddish yellow face with its gray mane     which, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole ser ice.

He judged by the cautious mo ements of those who crowded round the in alid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were mo ing him.

"Catch hold of my arm or you'll drop him!" he heard one of the ser ants say in a frightened whisper. "Catch hold from underneath. Here!" exclaimed different  oices  and the hea y breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the weight they were carrying were too much for them.

As the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikhaylo na, passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying man's high, stout, unco ered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly, leonine head.

This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones, its handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was not disfigured by the approach of death.

It was the same as Pierre remembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to Petersburg.

But now this head was swaying helplessly with the une en mo ements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing.

After a few minutes' bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had carried the sick man dispersed.

Anna Mikhaylo na touched Pierre's hand and said,

"Come." Pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed.

He lay with his head propped high on the pillows.

His hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms downward.

When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man.

Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere, or it meant too much.

Pierre hesitated, not knowing what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide.

Anna Mikhaylo na made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick man's hand and mo ing her lips as if to send it a kiss.

Pierre, carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand.

Neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count's face stirred.

Once more Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikhaylo na to see what he was to do next.

Anna Mikhaylo na with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed.

Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were doing right.

Anna Mikhaylo na nodded appro ingly.

Again Pierre fell into the nai ely symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, e idently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible.

He looked at the count, who still gazed at the spot where Pierre's face had been before he sat down.

Anna Mikhaylo na indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son.

This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an hour.

Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count's face began to twitch.

The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound.

Anna Mikhaylo na looked attenti ely at the sick man's eyes, trying to guess what he wanted  she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink, then named Prince  asili in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the quilt.

The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience.

He made an effort to look at the ser ant who stood constantly at the head of the bed.

"Wants to turn on the other side," whispered the ser ant, and got up to turn the count's hea y body toward the wall.

Pierre rose to help him.

While the count was being turned o er, one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward.

Whether he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm, or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre's terror stricken face, and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile appeared, quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride his own helplessness.

At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected qui ering in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his eyes.

The sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall.

He sighed.

"He is dozing," said Anna Mikhaylo na, obser ing that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at watching. "Let us go."

Pierre went out.

CHAPTER XXI 

There was now no one in the reception room except Prince  asili and the eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the Great and talking eagerly.

As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she whispered 

"I can't bear the sight of that woman."

"Catiche has had tea ser ed in the small drawing room," said Prince  asili to Anna Mikhaylo na.

"Go and take something, my poor Anna Mikhaylo na, or you will not hold out."

To Pierre he said nothing, merely gi ing his arm a sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder.

Pierre went with Anna Mikhaylo na into the small drawing room.

"There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious Russian tea," Lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small circular room.

Around the table all who were at Count Bezukho 's house that night had gathered to fortify themsel es.

Pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables.

During balls gi en at the house Pierre, who did not know how to dance, had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who, as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themsel es in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections se eral times.

Now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the middle of the night a motley throng of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly whispering, and betraying by e ery word and mo ement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom.

Pierre did not eat anything though he would  ery much ha e liked to.

He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince  asili and the eldest princess.

Pierre concluded that this also was essential, and after a short inter al followed her.

Anna Mikhaylo na was standing beside the princess, and they were both speaking in excited whispers.

"Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not necessary," said the younger of the two speakers, e idently in the same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.

"But, my dear princess," answered Anna Mikhaylo na blandly but impressi ely, blocking the way to the bedroom and pre enting the other from passing, "won't this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he needs repose?

Worldly con ersation at a moment when his soul is already prepared..."

Prince  asili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude, with one leg crossed high abo e the other.

His cheeks, which were so flabby that they looked hea ier below, were twitching  iolently  but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying.

"Come, my dear Anna Mikhaylo na, let Catiche do as she pleases. You know how fond the count is of her."

"I don't e en know what is in this paper," said the younger of the two ladies, addressing Prince  asili and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand. "All I know is that his real will is in his writing table, and this is a paper he has forgotten...."

She tried to pass Anna Mikhaylo na, but the latter sprang so as to bar her path.

"I know, my dear, kind princess," said Anna Mikhaylo na, seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily. "Dear princess, I beg and implore you, ha e some pity on him!

Je  ous en conjure..."

The princess did not reply.

Their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was e ident that if the princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna Mikhaylo na.

Though the latter held on tenaciously, her  oice lost none of its honeyed firmness and softness.

"Pierre, my dear, come here.

I think he will not be out of place in a family consultation  is it not so, Prince?"

"Why don't you speak, cousin?" suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled. "Why do you remain silent when hea en knows who permits herself to interfere, making a scene on the  ery threshold of a dying man's room?

Intriguer!" she hissed  iciously, and tugged with all her might at the portfolio.

But Anna Mikhaylo na went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the portfolio, and changed her grip.

Prince  asili rose. "Oh!" said he with reproach and surprise, "this is absurd!

Come, let go I tell you."

The princess let go.

"And you too!"

But Anna Mikhaylo na did not obey him.

"Let go, I tell you!

I will take the responsibility.

I myself will go and ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?"

"But, Prince," said Anna Mikhaylo na, "after such a solemn sacrament, allow him a moment's peace!

Here, Pierre, tell them your opinion," said she, turning to the young man who, ha ing come quite close, was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince  asili.

"Remember that you will answer for the consequences," said Prince  asili se erely. "You don't know what you are doing."

" ile woman!" shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna Mikhaylo na and snatching the portfolio from her.

Prince  asili bent his head and spread out his hands.

At this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her hands.

"What are you doing!" she cried  ehemently. "He is dying and you lea e me alone with him!"

Her sister dropped the portfolio.

Anna Mikhaylo na, stooping, quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom.

The eldest princess and Prince  asili, reco ering themsel es, followed her.

A few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again biting her underlip.

At sight of Pierre her expression showed an irrepressible hatred.

"Yes, now you may be glad!" said she  "this is what you ha e been waiting for."

And bursting into tears she hid her face in her handkerchief and rushed from the room.

Prince  asili came next.

He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was sitting and dropped onto it, co ering his face with his hand.

Pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw qui ered and shook as if in an ague.

"Ah, my friend!" said he, taking Pierre by the elbow  and there was in his  oice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had ne er obser ed in it before. "How often we sin, how much we decei e, and all for what?

I am near sixty, dear friend... I too... All will end in death, all!

Death is awful..." and he burst into tears.

Anna Mikhaylo na came out last.

She approached Pierre with slow, quiet steps.

"Pierre!" she said.

Pierre ga e her an inquiring look.

She kissed the young man on his forehead, wetting him with her tears.

Then after a pause she said 

"He is no more...."

Pierre looked at her o er his spectacles.

"Come, I will go with you.

Try to weep, nothing gi es such relief as tears."

She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could see his face.

Anna Mikhaylo na left him, and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm.

In the morning Anna Mikhaylo na said to Pierre 

"Yes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you.

But God will support you  you are young, and are now, I hope, in command of an immense fortune.

The will has not yet been opened.

I know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes duties on you, and you must be a man."

Pierre was silent.

"Perhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been there, God only knows what would ha e happened!

You know, Uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget Boris.

But he had no time.

I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father's wish?"

Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence at Princess Anna Mikhaylo na.

After her talk with Pierre, Anna Mikhaylo na returned to the Rosto s' and went to bed.

On waking in the morning she told the Rosto s and all her acquaintances the details of Count Bezukho 's death.

She said the count had died as she would herself wish to die, that his end was not only touching but edifying. As to the last meeting between father and son, it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears, and did not know which had beha ed better during those awful moments     the father who so remembered e erything and e erybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son, or Pierre, whom it had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he with grief, though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father.

"It is painful, but it does one good. It uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son," said she.

Of the beha ior of the eldest princess and Prince  asili she spoke disappro ingly, but in whispers and as a great secret.

CHAPTER XX 

At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andree ich Bolkonski's estate, the arri al of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old prince's household.

General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andree ich (nicknamed in society, "the King of Prussia") e er since the Emperor Paul had exiled him to his country estate had li ed there continuously with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle Bourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals, he still continued to li e in the country, remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing.

He used to say that there are only two sources of human  ice     idleness and superstition, and only two  irtues     acti ity and intelligence.

He himself undertook his daughter's education, and to de elop these two cardinal  irtues in her ga e her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was occupied.

He was himself always occupied  writing his memoirs, sol ing problems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working in the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on at his estate.

As regularity is a prime condition facilitating acti ity, regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of exactitude.

He always came to table under precisely the same conditions, and not only at the same hour but at the same minute.

With those about him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and in ariably exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men would ha e aroused.

Although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, e ery high official appointed to the pro ince in which the prince's estate lay considered it his duty to  isit him and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour.

E eryone sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and e en fear when the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd, youthfully glittering eyes.

On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arri e, Princess Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a silent prayer.

E ery morning she came in like that, and e ery morning prayed that the daily inter iew might pass off well.

An old powdered manser ant who was sitting in the antechamber rose quietly and said in a whisper 

"Please walk in."

Through the door came the regular hum of a lathe.

The princess timidly opened the door which mo ed noiselessly and easily. She paused at the entrance.

The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round continued his work.

The enormous study was full of things e idently in constant use.

The large table co ered with books and plans, the tall glass fronted bookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while standing up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with tools laid ready to hand and sha ings scattered around     all indicated continuous,  aried, and orderly acti ity.

The motion of the small foot shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with sil er, and the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince still possessed the tenacious endurance and  igor of hardy old age.

After a few more turns of the lathe he remo ed his foot from the pedal, wiped his chisel, dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching the table, summoned his daughter.

He ne er ga e his children a blessing, so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet unsha en) and, regarding her tenderly and attenti ely, said se erely 

"Quite well? All right then, sit down."

He took the exercise book containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair with his foot.

"For tomorrow!" said he, quickly finding the page and making a scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.

The princess bent o er the exercise book on the table.

"Wait a bit, here's a letter for you," said the old man suddenly, taking a letter addressed in a woman's hand from a bag hanging abo e the table, onto which he threw it.

At the sight of the letter red patches showed themsel es on the princess' face.

She took it quickly and bent her head o er it.

"From Heloise?" asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still sound, yellowish teeth.

"Yes, it's from Julie," replied the princess with a timid glance and a timid smile.

"I'll let two more letters pass, but the third I'll read," said the prince sternly  "I'm afraid you write much nonsense.

I'll read the third!"

"Read this if you like, Father," said the princess, blushing still more and holding out the letter.

"The third, I said the third!" cried the prince abruptly, pushing the letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the exercise book containing geometrical figures.

"Well, madam," he began, stooping o er the book close to his daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat, so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age and tobacco, which she had known so long. "Now, madam, these triangles are equal  please note that the angle ABC..."

The princess looked in a scared way at her father's eyes glittering close to her  the red patches on her face came and went, and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would pre ent her understanding any of her father's further explanations, howe er clear they might be.

Whether it was the teacher's fault or the pupil's, this same thing happened e ery day  the princess' eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear anything, but was only conscious of her stern father's withered face close to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace.

The old man was beside himself  mo ed the chair on which he was sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to control himself and not become  ehement, but almost always did become  ehement, scolded, and sometimes flung the exercise book away.

The princess ga e a wrong answer.

"Well now, isn't she a fool!" shouted the prince, pushing the book aside and turning sharply away  but rising immediately, he paced up and down, lightly touched his daughter's hair and sat down again.

He drew up his chair, and continued to explain.

"This won't do, Princess  it won't do," said he, when Princess Mary, ha ing taken and closed the exercise book with the next day's lesson, was about to lea e  "Mathematics are most important, madam!

I don't want to ha e you like our silly ladies.

Get used to it and you'll like it," and he patted her cheek. "It will dri e all the nonsense out of your head."

She turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut book from the high desk.

"Here is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your Heloise has sent you.

Religious!

I don't interfere with anyone's belief... I ha e looked at it.

Take it.

Well, now go. Go."

He patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her.

Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer. She sat down at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits and which was littered with books and papers.

The princess was as untidy as her father was tidy.

She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter.

It was from her most intimate friend from childhood  that same Julie Karagina who had been at the Rosto s' name day party.

Julie wrote in French 

Dear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is separation!

Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness are wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance separating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heart rebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me I cannot o ercome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart e er since we parted.

Why are we not together as we were last summer, in your big study, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa?

Why cannot I now, as three months ago, draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a look I lo ed so well and seem to see before me as I write?

Ha ing read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror which stood on her right.

It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and thin face.

Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular hopelessness at her reflection in the glass.

"She flatters me," thought the princess, turning away and continuing to read.

But Julie did not flatter her friend, the princess' eyes     large, deep and luminous (it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light)     were so beautiful that  ery often in spite of the plainness of her face they ga e her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty.

But the princess ne er saw the beautiful expression of her own eyes     the look they had when she was not thinking of herself.

As with e eryone, her face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass.

She went on reading 

All Moscow talks of nothing but war.

One of my two brothers is already abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march to the frontier.

Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war.

God grant that the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may be o erthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty, in His goodness, to gi e us as so ereign!

To say nothing of my brothers, this war has depri ed me of one of the associations nearest my heart.

I mean young Nicholas Rosto , who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain inacti e and has left the uni ersity to join the army.

I will confess to you, dear Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a great grief to me.

This young man, of whom I spoke to you last summer, is so noble minded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly, he is so frank and has so much heart.

He is so pure and poetic that my relations with him, transient as they were, ha e been one of the sweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered so much.

Someday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then.

That is still too fresh. Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know these poignant joys and sorrows.

You are fortunate, for the latter are generally the stronger!

I know  ery well that Count Nicholas is too young e er to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship, this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed.

But enough of this!

The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of old Count Bezukho , and his inheritance.

Fancy! The three princesses ha e recei ed  ery little, Prince  asili nothing, and it is Monsieur Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate  so that he is now Count Bezukho  and possessor of the finest fortune in Russia.

It is rumored that Prince  asili played a  ery despicable part in this affair and that he returned to Petersburg quite crestfallen.

I confess I understand  ery little about all these matters of wills and inheritance  but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bezukho  and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters, and of the young ladies themsel es, toward him, though, between you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow.

As for the past two years people ha e amused themsel es by finding husbands for me (most of whom I don't e en know), the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess Bezukho a.

But you will understand that I ha e no desire for the post.

A propos of marriages  do you know that a while ago that uni ersal auntie Anna Mikhaylo na told me, under the seal of strict secrecy, of a plan of marriage for you.

It is neither more nor less than with Prince  asili's son Anatole, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich and distinguee, and it is on you that his relations' choice has fallen.

I don't know what you will think of it, but I consider it my duty to let you know of it.

He is said to be  ery handsome and a terrible scapegrace.

That is all I ha e been able to find out about him.

But enough of gossip.

I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apraksins'.

Read the mystical book I am sending you  it has an enormous success here.

Though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp, it is an admirable book which calms and ele ates the soul.

Adieu!

Gi e my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle Bourienne.

I embrace you as I lo e you.

JULIE

P.S.

Let me ha e news of your brother and his charming little wife.

The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed.

Then she suddenly rose and with her hea y tread went up to the table. She took a sheet of paper and her hand mo ed rapidly o er it.

This is the reply she wrote, also in French 

Dear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has gi en me great delight.

So you still lo e me, my romantic Julie?

Separation, of which you say so much that is bad, does not seem to ha e had its usual effect on you.

You complain of our separation. What then should I say, if I dared complain, I who am depri ed of all who are dear to me?

Ah, if we had not religion to console us life would be  ery sad.

Why do you suppose that I should look se erely on your affection for that young man?

On such matters I am only se ere with myself.

I understand such feelings in others, and if ne er ha ing felt them I cannot appro e of them, neither do I condemn them.

Only it seems to me that Christian lo e, lo e of one's neighbor, lo e of one's enemy, is worthier, sweeter, and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and lo ing young girl like yourself.

The news of Count Bezukho 's death reached us before your letter and my father was much affected by it.

He says the count was the last representati e but one of the great century, and that it is his own turn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as possible.

God preser e us from that terrible misfortune!

I cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child.

He always seemed to me to ha e an excellent heart, and that is the quality I  alue most in people.

As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince  asili, it is  ery sad for both.

Ah, my dear friend, our di ine Sa iour's words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, are terribly true.

I pity Prince  asili but am still more sorry for Pierre.

So young, and burdened with such riches     to what temptations he will be exposed!

If I were asked what I desire most on earth, it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar.

A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the  olume you ha e sent me and which has such success in Moscow.

Yet since you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit.

I ne er could understand the fondness some people ha e for confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and excite their imagination, gi ing them a bent for exaggeration quite contrary to Christian simplicity.

Let us rather read the Epistles and Gospels.

Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain  for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the terrible and holy secrets of Pro idence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable  eil between us and the Eternal?

Let us rather confine oursel es to studying those sublime rules which our di ine Sa iour has left for our guidance here below. Let us try to conform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him  and the less we seek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will He  ouchsafe its re elation to us through His di ine Spirit.

My father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that he has recei ed a letter and is expecting a  isit from Prince  asili. In regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet friend, that I look on marriage as a di ine institution to which we must conform.

Howe er painful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as faithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom He may gi e me for husband.

I ha e had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arri al at Bald Hills with his wife.

This pleasure will be but a brief one, howe er, for he will lea e, us again to take part in this unhappy war into which we ha e been drawn, God knows how or why.

Not only where you are     at the heart of affairs and of the world     is the talk all of war, e en here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature     which townsfolk consider characteristic of the country     rumors of war are heard and painfully felt.

My father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches, things of which I understand nothing  and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the  illage I witnessed a heartrending scene....

It was a con oy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the army.

You should ha e seen the state of the mothers, wi es, and children of the men who were going and should ha e heard the sobs.

It seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its di ine Sa iour, Who preached lo e and forgi eness of injuries     and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing one another.

Adieu, dear and kind friend  may our di ine Sa iour and His most Holy Mother keep you in their holy and all powerful care!

MARY

"Ah, you are sending off a letter, Princess?

I ha e already dispatched mine.

I ha e written to my poor mother," said the smiling Mademoiselle Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r's. She brought into Princess Mary's strenuous, mournful, and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and self satisfied.

"Princess, I must warn you," she added, lowering her  oice and e idently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with exaggerated grasseyement, "the prince has been scolding Michael I ano ich.

He is in a  ery bad humor,  ery morose.

Be prepared."

"Ah, dear friend," replied Princess Mary,

"I ha e asked you ne er to warn me of the humor my father is in.

I do not allow myself to judge him and would not ha e others do so."

The princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was fi e minutes late in starting her practice on the cla ichord, went into the sitting room with a look of alarm.

Between twel e and two o'clock, as the day was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played the cla ichord.

CHAPTER XX I

The gray haired  alet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of the prince, who was in his large study.

From the far side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages     twenty times repeated     of a sonata by Dussek.

Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood dro e up to the porch. Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to alight, and let her pass into the house before him.

Old Tikhon, wearing a wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber, reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door.

Tikhon knew that neither the son's arri al nor any other unusual e ent must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day.

Prince Andrew apparently knew this as well as Tikhon  he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his father's habits had changed since he was at home last, and, ha ing assured himself that they had not, he turned to his wife.

"He will get up in twenty minutes.

Let us go across to Mary's room," he said.

The little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes and her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as merrily and prettily as e er.

"Why, this is a palace!" she said to her husband, looking around with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball. "Let's come, quick, quick!" And with a glance round, she smiled at Tikhon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.

"Is that Mary practicing?

Let's go quietly and take her by surprise."

Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.

"You' e grown older, Tikhon," he said in passing to the old man, who kissed his hand.

Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the cla ichord came, the pretty, fair haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne, rushed out apparently beside herself with delight.

"Ah! what joy for the princess!" exclaimed she 

"At last!

I must let her know."

"No, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne," said the little princess, kissing her. "I know you already through my sister in law's friendship for you.

She was not expecting us?"

They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound of the oft repeated passage of the sonata.

Prince Andrew stopped and made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.

The little princess entered the room.

The passage broke off in the middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Mary's hea y tread and the sound of kissing.

When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in each other's arms warmly pressing their lips to whate er place they happened to touch.

Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and ob iously equally ready to cry or to laugh.

Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as lo ers of music do when they hear a false note.

The two women let go of one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each other's hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince Andrew's surprise both began to cry and kissed again.

Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to cry.

Prince Andrew e idently felt ill at ease, but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently it ne er entered their heads that it could ha e been otherwise at this meeting.

"Ah! my dear!... Ah!

Mary!" they suddenly exclaimed, and then laughed.

"I dreamed last night..."     "You were not expecting us?..." "Ah! Mary, you ha e got thinner?..." "And you ha e grown stouter!..."

"I knew the princess at once," put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.

"And I had no idea!..." exclaimed Princess Mary.

"Ah, Andrew, I did not see you."

Prince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and he told her she was still the same crybaby as e er.

Princess Mary had turned toward her brother, and through her tears the lo ing, warm, gentle look of her large luminous eyes,  ery beautiful at that moment, rested on Prince Andrew's face.

The little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes.

She told of an accident they had had on the Spasski Hill which might ha e been serious for her in her condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in Petersburg and that hea en knew what she would ha e to dress in here  and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty Odyntso a had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary, a real one, but that they would talk of that later.

Princess Mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of lo e and sadness.

It was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of her sister in law's words.

In the midst of a description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother 

"So you are really going to the war, Andrew?" she said sighing.

Lise sighed too.

"Yes, and e en tomorrow," replied her brother.

"He is lea ing me here, God knows why, when he might ha e had promotion..."

Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of thought turned to her sister in law with a tender glance at her figure.

"Is it certain?" she said.

The face of the little princess changed.

She sighed and said 

"Yes, quite certain.

Ah! it is  ery dreadful..."

Her lip descended.

She brought her face close to her sister in law's and unexpectedly again began to cry.

"She needs rest," said Prince Andrew with a frown. "Don't you, Lise?

Take her to your room and I'll go to Father.

How is he? Just the same?"

"Yes, just the same. Though I don't know what your opinion will be," answered the princess joyfully.

"And are the hours the same? And the walks in the a enues?

And the lathe?" asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that, in spite of all his lo e and respect for his father, he was aware of his weaknesses.

"The hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and my geometry lessons," said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.

When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old prince to get up, Tikhon came to call the young prince to his father.

The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his son's arri al  he ga e orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner.

The old prince always dressed in old fashioned style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair  and when Prince Andrew entered his father's dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which he talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather co ered chair, wrapped in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to Tikhon.

"Ah! here's the warrior!

Wants to  anquish Buonaparte?" said the old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which Tikhon was holding fast to plait, would allow. "You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like this he'll soon ha e us, too, for his subjects! How are you?" And he held out his cheek.

The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He used to say that a nap "after dinner was sil er     before dinner, golden.") He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his thick, bushy eyebrows.

Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him.

He made no reply on his father's fa orite topic     making fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly of Bonaparte.

"Yes, Father, I ha e come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant," said Prince Andrew, following e ery mo ement of his father's face with an eager and respectful look. "How is your health?"

"Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me  I am busy from morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well."

"Thank God," said his son smiling.

"God has nothing to do with it!

Well, go on," he continued, returning to his hobby  "tell me how the Germans ha e taught you to fight Bonaparte by this new science you call 'strategy.'"

Prince Andrew smiled.

"Gi e me time to collect my wits, Father," said he, with a smile that showed that his father's foibles did not pre ent his son from lo ing and honoring him. "Why, I ha e not yet had time to settle down!"

"Nonsense, nonsense!" cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. "The house for your wife is ready.

Princess Mary will take her there and show her o er, and they'll talk nineteen to the dozen.

That's their woman's way!

I am glad to ha e her.

Sit down and talk.

About Mikhelson's army I understand     Tolstoy's too... a simultaneous expedition.... But what's the southern army to do?

Prussia is neutral... I know that.

What about Austria?" said he, rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room followed by Tikhon, who ran after him, handing him different articles of clothing. "What of Sweden?

How will they cross Pomerania?"

Prince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began     at first reluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from habit changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on     to explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign.

He explained how an army, ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war  how part of that army was to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund  how two hundred and twenty thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in Italy and on the Rhine  how fifty thousand Russians and as many English were to land at Naples, and how a total force of fi e hundred thousand men was to attack the French from different sides.

The old prince did not e ince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were not listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three times unexpectedly interrupted.

Once he stopped it by shouting 

"The white one, the white one!"

This meant that Tikhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted.

Another time he interrupted, saying 

"And will she soon be confined?" and shaking his head reproachfully said  "That's bad!

Go on, go on."

The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his description. The old man began to sing, in the cracked  oice of old age 

"Malbrook s'en  a t en guerre.

Dieu sait quand re iendra."     "Marlborough is going to the wars  God knows when he'll return."

His son only smiled.

"I don't say it's a plan I appro e of," said the son  "I am only telling you what it is.

Napoleon has also formed his plan by now, not worse than this one."

"Well, you' e told me nothing new," and the old man repeated, meditati ely and rapidly  "Dieu sait quand re iendra. Go to the dining room."

CHAPTER XX II

At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and sha en, entered the dining room where his daughter in law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect, who by a strange caprice of his employer's was admitted to table though the position of that insignificant indi idual was such as could certainly not ha e caused him to expect that honor.

The prince, who generally kept  ery strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted e en important go ernment officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael I ano ich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals, and had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael I ano ich was "not a whit worse than you or I."

At dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn Michael I ano ich more often than to anyone else.

In the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen     one behind each chair     stood waiting for the prince to enter. The head butler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by which the prince was to enter.

Prince Andrew was looking at a large gilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes Bolkonski, opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait (e idently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate) of a ruling prince, in a crown     an alleged descendant of Rurik and ancestor of the Bolkonskis.

Prince Andrew, looking again at that genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing.

"How thoroughly like him that is!" he said to Princess Mary, who had come up to him.

Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise.

She did not understand what he was laughing at.

E erything her father did inspired her with re erence and was beyond question.

"E eryone has his Achilles' heel," continued Prince Andrew. "Fancy, with his powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!"

Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother's criticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were heard coming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his house.

At that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room.

The prince stood still  his li ely glittering eyes from under their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on the little princess.

She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around him.

He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of her neck.

"I'm glad, glad, to see you," he said, looking attenti ely into her eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down. "Sit down, sit down!

Sit down, Michael Iano ich!"

He indicated a place beside him to his daughter in law.

A footman mo ed the chair for her.

"Ho, ho!" said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure. "You' e been in a hurry. That's bad!"

He laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only and not with his eyes.

"You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible," he said.

The little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words.

She was silent and seemed confused.

The prince asked her about her father, and she began to smile and talk.

He asked about mutual acquaintances, and she became still more animated and chattered away gi ing him greetings from  arious people and retailing the town gossip.

"Countess Apraksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has cried her eyes out," she said, growing more and more li ely.

As she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly, and suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael I ano ich.

"Well, Michael I ano ich, our Bonaparte will be ha ing a bad time of it.

Prince Andrew" (he always spoke thus of his son) "has been telling me what forces are being collected against him!

While you and I ne er thought much of him."

Michael I ano ich did not at all know when "you and I" had said such things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the prince's fa orite topic, he looked inquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would follow.

"He is a great tactician!" said the prince to his son, pointing to the architect.

And the con ersation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the generals and statesmen of the day.

The old prince seemed con inced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant little Frenchy, successful only because there were no longer any Potemkins or Su oro s left to oppose him  but he was also con inced that there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war, but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing, pretending to do something real.

Prince Andrew gaily bore with his father's ridicule of the new men, and drew him on and listened to him with e ident pleasure.

"The past always seems good," said he, "but did not Su oro  himself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know how to escape?"

"Who told you that?

Who?" cried the prince. "Su oro !" And he jerked away his plate, which Tikhon briskly caught. "Su oro !... Consider, Prince Andrew.

Two... Frederick and Su oro   Moreau!...

Moreau would ha e been a prisoner if Su oro  had had a free hand  but he had the Hofs kriegs wurst schnapps Rath on his hands.

It would ha e puzzled the de il himself!

When you get there you'll find out what those Hofs kriegs wurst Raths are!

Su oro  couldn't manage them so what chance has Michael Kutuzo ?

No, my dear boy," he continued, "you and your generals won't get on against Buonaparte  you'll ha e to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight together.

The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to fetch the Frenchman, Moreau," he said, alluding to the in itation made that year to Moreau to enter the Russian ser ice.... "Wonderful!... Were the Potemkins, Su oro s, and Orlo s Germans?

No, lad, either you fellows ha e all lost your wits, or I ha e outli ed mine.

May God help you, but we'll see what will happen.

Buonaparte has become a great commander among them!

Hm!..."

"I don't at all say that all the plans are good," said Prince Andrew, "I am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte.

You may laugh as much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great general!"

"Michael I ano ich!" cried the old prince to the architect who, busy with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten  "Didn't I tell you Buonaparte was a great tactician?

Here, he says the same thing."

"To be sure, your excellency," replied the architect.

The prince again laughed his frigid laugh.

"Buonaparte was born with a sil er spoon in his mouth.

He has got splendid soldiers.

Besides he began by attacking Germans.

And only idlers ha e failed to beat the Germans.

Since the world began e erybody has beaten the Germans.

They beat no one     except one another.

He made his reputation fighting them."

And the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and e en in politics.

His son made no rejoinder, but it was e ident that whate er arguments were presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion.

He listened, refraining from a reply, and in oluntarily wondered how this old man, li ing alone in the country for so many years, could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and political e ents.

"You think I'm an old man and don't understand the present state of affairs?" concluded his father. "But it troubles me.

I don't sleep at night.

Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown his skill?" he concluded.

"That would take too long to tell," answered the son.

"Well, then go to your Buonaparte!

Mademoiselle Bourienne, here's another admirer of that powder monkey emperor of yours," he exclaimed in excellent French.

"You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!"

"Dieu sait quand re iendra..." hummed the prince out of tune and, with a laugh still more so, he quitted the table.

The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her father in law and now at Princess Mary.

When they left the table she took her sister in law's arm and drew her into another room.

"What a cle er man your father is," said she  "perhaps that is why I am afraid of him."

"Oh, he is so kind!" answered Princess Mary.

CHAPTER XX III

Prince Andrew was to lea e next e ening.

The old prince, not altering his routine, retired as usual after dinner.

The little princess was in her sister in law's room.

Prince Andrew in a tra eling coat without epaulettes had been packing with his  alet in the rooms assigned to him.

After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he ordered the horses to be harnessed.

Only those things he always kept with him remained in his room  a small box, a large canteen fitted with sil er plate, two Turkish pistols and a saber     a present from his father who had brought it from the siege of Ochako .

All these tra eling effects of Prince Andrew's were in  ery good order  new, clean, and in cloth co ers carefully tied with tapes.

When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind.

At such moments one re iews the past and plans for the future.

Prince Andrew's face looked  ery thoughtful and tender.

With his hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room, looking straight before him and thoughtfully shaking his head.

Did he fear going to the war, or was he sad at lea ing his wife?     perhaps both, but e idently he did not wish to be seen in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the co er of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression.

It was the hea y tread of Princess Mary that he heard.

"I hear you ha e gi en orders to harness," she cried, panting (she had apparently been running), "and I did so wish to ha e another talk with you alone!

God knows how long we may again be parted.

You are not angry with me for coming?

You ha e changed so, Andrusha," she added, as if to explain such a question.

She smiled as she uttered his pet name,

"Andrusha."

It was ob iously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be Andrusha     the slender mischie ous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood.

"And where is Lise?" he asked, answering her question only by a smile.

"She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room.

Oh, Andrew!

What a treasure of a wife you ha e," said she, sitting down on the sofa, facing her brother. "She is quite a child  such a dear, merry child.

I ha e grown so fond of her."

Prince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face.

"One must be indulgent to little weaknesses  who is free from them, Andrew?

Don't forget that she has grown up and been educated in society, and so her position now is not a rosy one.

We should enter into e eryone's situation.

Tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner.   Think what it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to, to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country, in her condition!

It's  ery hard."

  To understand all is to forgi e all. Prince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we think we thoroughly understand.

"You li e in the country and don't think the life terrible," he replied.

"I... that's different.

Why speak of me?

I don't want any other life, and can't, for I know no other.

But think, Andrew  for a young society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life, all alone     for Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know what poor resources I ha e for entertaining a woman used to the best society.

There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne...."

"I don't like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all," said Prince Andrew.

"No?

She is  ery nice and kind and, abo e all, she's much to be pitied. She has no one, no one.

To tell the truth, I don't need her, and she's e en in my way.

You know I always was a sa age, and now am e en more so.

I like being alone.... Father likes her  ery much.

She and Michael I ano ich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says  'We don't lo e people so much for the good they ha e done us, as for the good we ha e done them.'

Father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father.

She is  ery good natured, and my father likes her way of reading.

She reads to him in the e enings and reads splendidly."

"To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father's character sometimes makes things trying for you, doesn't it?" Prince Andrew asked suddenly.

Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.

"For me? For me?... Trying for me!..." said she.

"He always was rather harsh  and now I should think he's getting  ery trying," said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister.

"You are good in e ery way, Andrew, but you ha e a kind of intellectual pride," said the princess, following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the con ersation     "and that's a great sin.

How can one judge Father?

But e en if one might, what feeling except  eneration could such a man as my father e oke?

And I am so contented and happy with him.

I only wish you were all as happy as I am."

Her brother shook his head incredulously.

"The only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth, Andrew... is Father's way of treating religious subjects.

I don't understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day, and can go so far astray.

That is the only thing that makes me unhappy.

But e en in this I can see lately a shade of impro ement.

His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a monk he recei ed and had a long talk with."

"Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder," said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.

"Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me.

Andrew..." she said timidly after a moment's silence, "I ha e a great fa or to ask of you."

"What is it, dear?"

"No     promise that you will not refuse!

It will gi e you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me.

Promise, Andrusha!..." said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was granted.

She looked timidly at her brother.

"E en if it were a great deal of trouble..." answered Prince Andrew, as if guessing what it was about.

"Think what you please!

I know you are just like Father.

Think as you please, but do this for my sake!

Please do!

Father's father, our grandfather, wore it in all his wars." (She still did not take out what she was holding in her reticule.) "So you promise?"

"Of course. What is it?"

"Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will ne er take it off.

Do you promise?"

"If it does not weigh a hundredweight and won't break my neck... To please you..." said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing the pained expression his joke had brought to his sister's face, he repented and added  "I am glad  really, dear, I am  ery glad."

"Against your will He will sa e and ha e mercy on you and bring you to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace," said she in a  oice trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small, o al, antique, dark faced icon of the Sa iour in a gold setting, on a finely wrought sil er chain.

She crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.

"Please, Andrew, for my sake!..."

Rays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes.

Those eyes lit up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful.

Her brother would ha e taken the icon, but she stopped him.

Andrew understood, crossed himself and kissed the icon.

There was a look of tenderness, for he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.

"Thank you, my dear."

She kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa.

They were silent for a while.

"As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always used to be.

Don't judge Lise harshly," she began. "She is so sweet, so good natured, and her position now is a  ery hard one."

"I do not think I ha e complained of my wife to you, Masha, or blamed her.

Why do you say all this to me?"

Red patches appeared on Princess Mary's face and she was silent as if she felt guilty.

"I ha e said nothing to you, but you ha e already been talked to.

And I am sorry for that," he went on.

The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks.

She tried to say something but could not.

Her brother had guessed right  the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her fate, her father in law, and her husband.

After crying she had fallen asleep.

Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.

"Know this, Masha  I can't reproach, ha e not reproached, and ne er shall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach myself with anything in regard to her  and that always will be so in whate er circumstances I may be placed.

But if you want to know the truth... if you want to know whether I am happy?

No!

Is she happy?

No!

But why this is so I don't know..."

As he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed her forehead.

His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and unaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but o er her head toward the darkness of the open doorway.

"Let us go to her, I must say good by.

Or     go and wake and I'll come in a moment.

Petrushka!" he called to his  alet  "Come here, take these away.

Put this on the seat and this to the right."

Princess Mary rose and mo ed to the door, then stopped and said 

"Andrew, if you had faith you would ha e turned to God and asked Him to gi e you the lo e you do not feel, and your prayer would ha e been answered."

"Well, may be!" said Prince Andrew. "Go, Masha  I'll come immediately."

On the way to his sister's room, in the passage which connected one wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling sweetly. It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.

"Oh! I thought you were in your room," she said, for some reason blushing and dropping her eyes.

Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly came o er his face.

He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word.

When he reached his sister's room his wife was already awake and her merry  oice, hurrying one word after another, came through the open door.

She was speaking as usual in French, and as if after long self restraint she wished to make up for lost time.

"No, but imagine the old Countess Zubo a, with false curls and her mouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age.... Ha, ha, ha! Mary!"

This  ery sentence about Countess Zubo a and this same laugh Prince Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some fi e times.

He entered the room softly.

The little princess, plump and rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking incessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and e en phrases.

Prince Andrew came up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after their journey.

She answered him and continued her chatter.

The coach with six horses was waiting at the porch.

It was an autumn night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole.

Ser ants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch.

The immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows.

The domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good by to the young prince. The members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall  Michael I ano ich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Mary, and the little princess.

Prince Andrew had been called to his father's study as the latter wished to say good by to him alone.

All were waiting for them to come out.

When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old age spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he recei ed no one but his son, sat at the table writing.

He glanced round.

"Going?" And he went on writing.

"I' e come to say good by."

"Kiss me here," and he touched his cheek  "Thanks, thanks!"

"What do you thank me for?"

"For not dilly dallying and not hanging to a woman's apron strings.

The Ser ice before e erything.

Thanks, thanks!" And he went on writing, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked.

"If you ha e anything to say, say it. These two things can be done together," he added.

"About my wife... I am ashamed as it is to lea e her on your hands..."

"Why talk nonsense?

Say what you want."

"When her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur.... Let him be here...."

The old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his stern eyes on his son.

"I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work," said Prince Andrew, e idently confused. "I know that out of a million cases only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine.

They ha e been telling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened."

"Hm... Hm..." muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he was writing. "I'll do it."

He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh.

"It's a bad business, eh?"

"What is bad, Father?"

"The wife!" said the old prince, briefly and significantly.

"I don't understand!" said Prince Andrew.

"No, it can't be helped, lad," said the prince. "They're all like that  one can't unmarry.

Don't be afraid  I won't tell anyone, but you know it yourself."

He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked straight into his son's face with keen eyes which seemed to see through him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.

The son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him.

The old man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and throwing down the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapidity.

"What's to be done?

She's pretty!

I will do e erything.

Make your mind easy," said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.

Andrew did not speak  he was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him.

The old man got up and ga e the letter to his son.

"Listen!" said he  "don't worry about your wife  what can be done shall be.

Now listen! Gi e this letter to Michael Ilariono ich.   I ha e written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you long as an adjutant  a bad position!

Tell him I remember and like him.

Write and tell me how he recei es you.

If he is all right     ser e him.

Nicholas Bolkonski's son need not ser e under anyone if he is in disfa or.

Now come here."

 Kutuzo . He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son was accustomed to understand him.

He led him to the desk, raised the lid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his bold, tall, close handwriting.

"I shall probably die before you.

So remember, these are my memoirs  hand them to the Emperor after my death.

Now here is a Lombard bond and a letter  it is a premium for the man who writes a history of Su oro 's wars.

Send it to the Academy.

Here are some jottings for you to read when I am gone. You will find them useful."

Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt li e a long time yet.

He felt that he must not say it.

"I will do it all, Father," he said.

"Well, now, good by!" He ga e his son his hand to kiss, and embraced him. "Remember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me, your old father..." he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous  oice suddenly shrieked  "but if I hear that you ha e not beha ed like a son of Nicholas Bolkonski, I shall be ashamed!"

"You need not ha e said that to me, Father," said the son with a smile.

The old man was silent.

"I also wanted to ask you," continued Prince Andrew, "if I'm killed and if I ha e a son, do not let him be taken away from you     as I said yesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please."

"Not let the wife ha e him?" said the old man, and laughed.

They stood silent, facing one another.

The old man's sharp eyes were fixed straight on his son's.

Something twitched in the lower part of the old prince's face.

"We' e said good by. Go!" he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry  oice, opening his door.

"What is it? What?" asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry  oice.

Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply.

"Well!" he said, turning to his wife.

And this "Well!" sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying,  "Now go through your performance."

"Andrew, already!" said the little princess, turning pale and looking with dismay at her husband.

He embraced her.

She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.

He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face, and carefully placed her in an easy chair.

"Adieu, Mary," said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand and kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.

The little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing her temples.

Princess Mary, supporting her sister in law, still looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction.

From the study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose.

Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown looked out.

"Gone?

That's all right!" said he  and looking angrily at the unconscious little princess, he shook his head repro ingly and slammed the door.

BOOK TWO  1805

CHAPTER I

In October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the  illages and towns of the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly arri ing from Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered.

Braunau was the headquarters of the commander in chief, Kutuzo .

On October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just reached Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be inspected by the commander in chief.

Despite the un Russian appearance of the locality and surroundings     fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs, and hills in the distance     and despite the fact that the inhabitants (who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the regiment had just the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia.

On the e ening of the last day's march an order had been recei ed that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march.

Though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is always better to "bow too low than not bow low enough."

So the soldiers, after a twenty mile march, were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes, while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned, and by morning the regiment     instead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before     presented a well ordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty, had e ery button and e ery strap in place, and shone with cleanliness.

And not only externally was all in order, but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would ha e found on e ery man a clean shirt, and in e ery knapsack the appointed number of articles, "awl, soap, and all," as the soldiers say.

There was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease.

It was the state of the soldiers' boots.

More than half the men's boots were in holes.

But this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian commissariat, and the regiment had marched some se en hundred miles.

The commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and thick set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders.

He had on a brand new uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massi e shoulders.

He had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life.

He walked about in front of the line and at e ery step pulled himself up, slightly arching his back.

It was plain that the commander admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military matters, social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts.

"Well, Michael Mitrich, sir?" he said, addressing one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain that they both felt happy). "We had our hands full last night.

Howe er, I think the regiment is not a bad one, eh?"

The battalion commander percei ed the jo ial irony and laughed.

"It would not be turned off the field e en on the Tsaritsin Meadow."

"What?" asked the commander.

At that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had been posted, two men appeared on horse back.

They were an aide de camp followed by a Cossack.

The aide de camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been clearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march  in their greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation whate er.

A member of the Hofkriegsrath from  ienna had come to Kutuzo  the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutuzo , not considering this junction ad isable, meant, among other arguments in support of his  iew, to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arri ed from Russia.

With this object he intended to meet the regiment  so the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander in chief would be.

Though the aide de camp did not know these circumstances, he ne ertheless deli ered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied.

On hearing this the regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture.

"A fine mess we' e made of it!" he remarked. "There now! Didn't I tell you, Michael Mitrich, that if it was said 'on the march' it meant in greatcoats?" said he reproachfully to the battalion commander. "Oh, my God!" he added, stepping resolutely forward. "Company commanders!" he shouted in a  oice accustomed to command. "Sergeants major!... How soon will he be here?" he asked the aide de camp with a respectful politeness e idently relating to the personage he was referring to.

"In an hour's time, I should say."

"Shall we ha e time to change clothes?"

"I don't know, General...."

The regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered the soldiers to change into their greatcoats.

The company commanders ran off to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the greatcoats were not in  ery good condition), and instantly the squares that had up to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and hum with  oices.

On all sides soldiers were running to and fro, throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps o er their heads, unstrapping their o ercoats and drawing the slee es on with upraised arms.

In half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had become gray instead of black.

The regimental commander walked with his jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance.

"Whate er is this?

This!" he shouted and stood still. "Commander of the third company!"

"Commander of the third company wanted by the general!... commander to the general... third company to the commander." The words passed along the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer.

When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a cry of  "The general to the third company," the missing officer appeared from behind his company and, though he was a middle aged man and not in the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the general.

The captain's face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned.

Spots appeared on his nose, the redness of which was e idently due to intemperance, and his mouth twitched ner ously.

The general looked the captain up and down as he came up panting, slackening his pace as he approached.

"You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats!

What is this?" shouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth, which contrasted with the others. "What ha e you been after?

The commander in chief is expected and you lea e your place?

Eh? I'll teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade.... Eh...?"

The commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior, pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this pressure lay his only hope of sal ation.

"Well, why don't you speak?

Whom ha e you got there dressed up as a Hungarian?" said the commander with an austere gibe.

"Your excellency..."

"Well, your excellency, what?

Your excellency!

But what about your excellency?... nobody knows."

"Your excellency, it's the officer Dolokho , who has been reduced to the ranks," said the captain softly.

"Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier?

If a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others."

"Your excellency, you ga e him lea e yourself, on the march."

"Ga e him lea e?

Lea e?

That's just like you young men," said the regimental commander cooling down a little. "Lea e indeed....

One says a word to you and you... What?" he added with renewed irritation, "I beg you to dress your men decently."

And the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his jerky steps down the line.

He was e idently pleased at his own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for wrath.

Ha ing snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge, at another because his line was not straight, he reached the third company.

"H o o w are you standing?

Where's your leg?

Your leg?" shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in his  oice, while there were still fi e men between him and Dolokho  with his bluish gray uniform.

Dolokho  slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with his clear, insolent eyes in the general's face.

"Why a blue coat?

Off with it... Sergeant major!

Change his coat... the ras..." he did not finish.

"General, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure..." Dolokho  hurriedly interrupted.

"No talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!"

"Not bound to endure insults," Dolokho  concluded in loud, ringing tones.

The eyes of the general and the soldier met.

The general became silent, angrily pulling down his tight scarf.

"I request you to ha e the goodness to change your coat," he said as he turned away.

CHAPTER II

"He's coming!" shouted the signaler at that moment.

The regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the stirrup with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself, drew his saber, and with a happy and resolute countenance, opening his mouth awry, prepared to shout.

The regiment fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless.

"Att ention!" shouted the regimental commander in a soul shaking  oice which expressed joy for himself, se erity for the regiment, and welcome for the approaching chief.

Along the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high, light blue  iennese caleche, slightly creaking on its springs and drawn by six horses at a smart trot.

Behind the caleche galloped the suite and a con oy of Croats.

Beside Kutuzo  sat an Austrian general, in a white uniform that looked strange among the Russian black ones.

The caleche stopped in front of the regiment.

Kutuzo  and the Austrian general were talking in low  oices and Kutuzo  smiled slightly as treading hea ily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist.

The word of command rang out, and again the regiment qui ered, as with a jingling sound it presented arms.

Then amidst a dead silence the feeble  oice of the commander in chief was heard.

The regiment roared,

"Health to your ex... len... len... lency!" and again all became silent.

At first Kutuzo  stood still while the regiment mo ed  then he and the general in white, accompanied by the suite, walked between the ranks.

From the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and de oured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky mo ements, and from the way he darted forward at e ery word or gesture of the commander in chief, it was e ident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with e en greater zeal than his duty as a commander.

Thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment, in comparison with others that had reached Braunau at the same time, was in splendid condition.

There were only 217 sick and stragglers.

E erything was in good order except the boots.

Kutuzo  walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war, sometimes also to the soldiers.

Looking at their boots he se eral times shook his head sadly, pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone, but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was.

The regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion, fearing to miss a single word of the commander in chief's regarding the regiment.

Behind Kutuzo , at a distance that allowed e ery softly spoken word to be heard, followed some twenty men of his suite.

These gentlemen talked among themsel es and sometimes laughed.

Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant.

This was Prince Bolkonski.

Beside him was his comrade Nes itski, a tall staff officer, extremely stout, with a kindly, smiling, handsome face and moist eyes. Nes itski could hardly keep from laughter pro oked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him.

This hussar, with a gra e face and without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes, watched the regimental commander's back and mimicked his e ery mo ement.

Each time the commander started and bent forward, the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same manner.

Nes itski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the wag.

Kutuzo  walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch their chief.

On reaching the third company he suddenly stopped.

His suite, not ha ing expected this, in oluntarily came closer to him.

"Ah, Timokhin!" said he, recognizing the red nosed captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.

One would ha e thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more than Timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander, but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not ha e sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look at him, and so Kutuzo , who e idently understood his case and wished him nothing but good, quickly turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting o er his scarred and puffy face.

"Another Ismail comrade," said he. "A bra e officer!

Are you satisfied with him?" he asked the regimental commander.

And the latter     unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar officer as in a looking glass     started, mo ed forward, and answered 

"Highly satisfied, your excellency!"

"We all ha e our weaknesses," said Kutuzo  smiling and walking away from him. "He used to ha e a predilection for Bacchus."

The regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did not answer.

The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red nosed captain and his drawn in stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose with such exactitude that Nes itski could not help laughing.

Kutuzo  turned round.

The officer e idently had complete control of his face, and while Kutuzo  was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most serious, deferential, and innocent expression.

The third company was the last, and Kutuzo  pondered, apparently trying to recollect something.

Prince Andrew stepped forward from among the suite and said in French 

"You told me to remind you of the officer Dolokho , reduced to the ranks in this regiment."

"Where is Dolokho ?" asked Kutuzo .

Dolokho , who had already changed into a soldier's gray greatcoat, did not wait to be called.

The shapely figure of the fair haired soldier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks, went up to the commander in chief, and presented arms.

"Ha e you a complaint to make?" Kutuzo  asked with a slight frown.

"This is Dolokho ," said Prince Andrew.

"Ah!" said Kutuzo . "I hope this will be a lesson to you. Do your duty.

The Emperor is gracious, and I shan't forget you if you deser e well."

The clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by their expression to tear open the  eil of con ention that separates a commander in chief so widely from a pri ate.

"One thing I ask of your excellency," Dolokho  said in his firm, ringing, deliberate  oice. "I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and pro e my de otion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!"

Kutuzo  turned away.

The same smile of the eyes with which he had turned from Captain Timokhin again flitted o er his face.

He turned away with a grimace as if to say that e erything Dolokho  had said to him and e erything he could say had long been known to him, that he was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted.

He turned away and went to the carriage.

The regiment broke up into companies, which went to their appointed quarters near Braunau, where they hoped to recei e boots and clothes and to rest after their hard marches.

"You won't bear me a grudge, Prokhor Ignatych?" said the regimental commander, o ertaking the third company on its way to its quarters and riding up to Captain Timokhin who was walking in front. (The regimental commander's face now that the inspection was happily o er beamed with irrepressible delight.) "It's in the Emperor's ser ice... it can't be helped... one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade... I am the first to apologize, you know me!... He was  ery pleased!" And he held out his hand to the captain.

"Don't mention it, General, as if I'd be so bold!" replied the captain, his nose growing redder as he ga e a smile which showed where two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at Ismail.

"And tell Mr. Dolokho  that I won't forget him     he may be quite easy.

And tell me, please     I' e been meaning to ask     how is he beha ing himself, and in general..."

"As far as the ser ice goes he is quite punctilious, your excellency  but his character..." said Timokhin.

"And what about his character?" asked the regimental commander.

"It's different on different days," answered the captain. "One day he is sensible, well educated, and good natured, and the next he's a wild beast....

In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew."

"Oh, well, well!" remarked the regimental commander. "Still, one must ha e pity on a young man in misfortune.

You know he has important connections... Well, then, you just..."

"I will, your excellency," said Timokhin, showing by his smile that he understood his commander's wish.

"Well, of course, of course!"

The regimental commander sought out Dolokho  in the ranks and, reining in his horse, said to him 

"After the next affair... epaulettes."

Dolokho  looked round but did not say anything, nor did the mocking smile on his lips change.

"Well, that's all right," continued the regimental commander. "A cup of  odka for the men from me," he added so that the soldiers could hear. "I thank you all!

God be praised!" and he rode past that company and o ertook the next one.

"Well, he's really a good fellow, one can ser e under him," said Timokhin to the subaltern beside him.

"In a word, a hearty one..." said the subaltern, laughing (the regimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts).

The cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the soldiers.

The company marched on gaily.

The soldiers'  oices could be heard on e ery side.

"And they said Kutuzo  was blind of one eye?"

"And so he is!

Quite blind!"

"No, friend, he is sharper eyed than you are.

Boots and leg bands... he noticed e erything..."

"When he looked at my feet, friend... well, thinks I..."

"And that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he were smeared with chalk     as white as flour!

I suppose they polish him up as they do the guns."

"I say, Fedeshon!... Did he say when the battles are to begin? You were near him.

E erybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau."

"Buonaparte himself!... Just listen to the fool, what he doesn't know!

The Prussians are up in arms now.

The Austrians, you see, are putting them down.

When they' e been put down, the war with Buonaparte will begin.

And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau!

Shows you're a fool.

You'd better listen more carefully!"

"What de ils these quartermasters are!

See, the fifth company is turning into the  illage already... they will ha e their buckwheat cooked before we reach our quarters."

"Gi e me a biscuit, you de il!"

"And did you gi e me tobacco yesterday?

That's just it, friend!

Ah, well, ne er mind, here you are."

"They might call a halt here or we'll ha e to do another four miles without eating."

"Wasn't it fine when those Germans ga e us lifts!

You just sit still and are drawn along."

"And here, friend, the people are quite beggarly.

There they all seemed to be Poles     all under the Russian crown     but here they're all regular Germans."

"Singers to the front" came the captain's order.

And from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front.

A drummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing his arm, began a long drawn out soldiers' song, commencing with the words 

"Morning dawned, the sun was rising," and concluding 

"On then, brothers, on to glory, led by Father Kamenski." This song had been composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria, the only change being that the words

"Father Kamenski" were replaced by

"Father Kutuzo ."

Ha ing jerked out these last words as soldiers do and wa ed his arms as if flinging something to the ground, the drummer     a lean, handsome soldier of forty     looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes.

Then ha ing satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him, he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some in isible but precious object abo e his head and, holding it there for some seconds, suddenly flung it down and began 

"Oh, my bower, oh, my bower...!"

"Oh, my bower new...!" chimed in twenty  oices, and the castanet player, in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the front and, walking backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone.

The soldiers, swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously, marched with long steps.

Behind the company the sound of wheels, the creaking of springs, and the tramp of horses' hoofs were heard.

Kutuzo  and his suite were returning to the town.

The commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease, and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men.

In the second file from the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the company, a blue eyed soldier in oluntarily attracted notice. It was Dolokho  marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at those dri ing past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company.

The hussar cornet of Kutuzo 's suite who had mimicked the regimental commander, fell back from the carriage and rode up to Dolokho .

Hussar cornet Zherko  had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to the wild set led by Dolokho .

Zherko  had met Dolokho  abroad as a pri ate and had not seen fit to recognize him.

But now that Kutuzo  had spoken to the gentleman ranker, he addressed him with the cordiality of an old friend.

"My dear fellow, how are you?" said he through the singing, making his horse keep pace with the company.

"How am I?" Dolokho  answered coldly. "I am as you see."

The li ely song ga e a special fla or to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which Zherko  spoke, and to the intentional coldness of Dolokho 's reply.

"And how do you get on with the officers?" inquired Zherko .

"All right. They are good fellows.

And how ha e you wriggled onto the staff?"

"I was attached  I'm on duty."

Both were silent.

"She let the hawk fly upward from her wide right slee e," went the song, arousing an in oluntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness.

Their con ersation would probably ha e been different but for the effect of that song.

"Is it true that Austrians ha e been beaten?" asked Dolokho .

"The de il only knows! They say so."

"I'm glad," answered Dolokho  briefly and clearly, as the song demanded.

"I say, come round some e ening and we'll ha e a game of faro!" said Zherko .

"Why, ha e you too much money?"

"Do come."

"I can't.

I' e sworn not to.

I won't drink and won't play till I get reinstated."

"Well, that's only till the first engagement."

"We shall see."

They were again silent.

"Come if you need anything. One can at least be of use on the staff..."

Dolokho  smiled.

"Don't trouble.

If I want anything, I won't beg     I'll take it!"

"Well, ne er mind  I only..."

"And I only..."

"Good by."

"Good health..."

"It's a long, long way.

To my nati e land..."

Zherko  touched his horse with the spurs  it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down, galloped past the company, and o ertook the carriage, still keeping time to the song.

CHAPTER III

On returning from the re iew, Kutuzo  took the Austrian general into his pri ate room and, calling his adjutant, asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arri al, and the letters that had come from the Archduke Ferdinand, who was in command of the ad anced army.

Prince Andrew Bolkonski came into the room with the required papers.

Kutuzo  and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out.

"Ah!..." said Kutuzo  glancing at Bolkonski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the con ersation in French.

"All I can say, General," said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word.

It was e ident that Kutuzo  himself listened with pleasure to his own  oice. "All I can say, General, is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis would ha e been fulfilled long ago.

I should long ago ha e joined the archduke.

And belie e me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand o er the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful general     of whom Austria has so many     and to lay down all this hea y responsibility.

But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us, General."

And Kutuzo  smiled in a way that seemed to say,

"You are quite at liberty not to belie e me and I don't e en care whether you do or not, but you ha e no grounds for telling me so.

And that is the whole point."

The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply in the same tone.

"On the contrary," he said, in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words, "on the contrary, your excellency's participation in the common action is highly  alued by His Majesty  but we think the present delay is depri ing the splendid Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they ha e been accustomed to win in their battles," he concluded his e idently prearranged sentence.

Kutuzo  bowed with the same smile.

"But that is my con iction, and judging by the last letter with which His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General Mack, ha e by now already gained a decisi e  ictory and no longer need our aid," said Kutuzo .

The general frowned.

Though there was no definite news of an Austrian defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the unfa orable rumors that were afloat, and so Kutuzo 's suggestion of an Austrian  ictory sounded much like irony.

But Kutuzo  went on blandly smiling with the same expression, which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so.

And, in fact, the last letter he had recei ed from Mack's army informed him of a  ictory and stated strategically the position of the army was  ery fa orable.

"Gi e me that letter," said Kutuzo  turning to Prince Andrew. "Please ha e a look at it"     and Kutuzo  with an ironical smile about the corners of his mouth read to the Austrian general the following passage, in German, from the Archduke Ferdinand's letter 

We ha e fully concentrated forces of nearly se enty thousand men with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech.

Also, as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be depri ed of the ad antage of commanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not cross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw oursel es on his line of communications, recross the ri er lower down, and frustrate his intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful ally.

We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial Russian army will be fully equipped, and shall then, in conjunction with it, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deser es.

Kutuzo  sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attenti ely.

"But you know the wise maxim your excellency, ad ising one to expect the worst," said the Austrian general, e idently wishing to ha e done with jests and to come to business.

He in oluntarily looked round at the aide de camp.

"Excuse me, General," interrupted Kutuzo , also turning to Prince Andrew. "Look here, my dear fellow, get from Kozlo ski all the reports from our scouts.

Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and here is one from His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are these," he said, handing him se eral papers, "make a neat memorandum in French out of all this, showing all the news we ha e had of the mo ements of the Austrian army, and then gi e it to his excellency."

Prince Andrew bowed his head in token of ha ing understood from the first not only what had been said but also what Kutuzo  would ha e liked to tell him.

He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both, stepped softly o er the carpet and went out into the waiting room.

Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia, he had changed greatly during that period.

In the expression of his face, in his mo ements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his former affected languor and indolence. He now looked like a man who has time to think of the impression he makes on others, but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work.

His face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him, his smile and glance were brighter and more attracti e.

Kutuzo , whom he had o ertaken in Poland, had recei ed him  ery kindly, promised not to forget him, distinguished him abo e the other adjutants, and had taken him to  ienna and gi en him the more serious commissions.

From  ienna Kutuzo  wrote to his old comrade, Prince Andrew's father.

Your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry, firmness, and expedition.

I consider myself fortunate to ha e such a subordinate by me.

On Kutuzo 's staff, among his fellow officers and in the army generally, Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two quite opposite reputations.

Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be different from themsel es and from e eryone else, expected great things of him, listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and with them Prince Andrew was natural and pleasant.

Others, the majority, disliked him and considered him conceited, cold, and disagreeable.

But among these people Prince Andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and e en feared him.

Coming out of Kutuzo 's room into the waiting room with the papers in his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide de camp on duty, Kozlo ski, who was sitting at the window with a book.

"Well, Prince?" asked Kozlo ski.

"I am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not ad ancing."

"And why is it?"

Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.

"Any news from Mack?"

"No."

"If it were true that he has been beaten, news would ha e come."

"Probably," said Prince Andrew mo ing toward the outer door. But at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the order of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head, who had e idently just arri ed, entered quickly, slamming the door.

Prince Andrew stopped short.

"Commander in Chief Kutuzo ?" said the newly arri ed general speaking quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides and ad ancing straight toward the inner door.

"The commander in chief is engaged," said Kozlo ski, going hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door. "Whom shall I announce?"

The unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozlo ski, who was rather short, as if surprised that anyone should not know him.

"The commander in chief is engaged," repeated Kozlo ski calmly.

The general's face clouded, his lips qui ered and trembled.

He took out a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out the leaf, ga e it to Kozlo ski, stepped quickly to the window, and threw himself into a chair, gazing at those in the room as if asking, "Why do they look at me?"

Then he lifted his head, stretched his neck as if he intended to say something, but immediately, with affected indifference, began to hum to himself, producing a queer sound which immediately broke off.

The door of the pri ate room opened and Kutuzo  appeared in the doorway.

The general with the bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some danger, and, making long, quick strides with his thin legs, went up to Kutuzo .

" ous  oyez le malheureux Mack," he uttered in a broken  oice.

Kutuzo 's face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly immobile for a few moments.

Then wrinkles ran o er his face like a wa e and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully, closed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before him, and closed the door himself behind him.

The report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm pro ed to be correct.

Within half an hour adjutants had been sent in  arious directions with orders which showed that the Russian troops, who had hitherto been inacti e, would also soon ha e to meet the enemy.

Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest lay in the general progress of the war.

When he saw Mack and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost, understood all the difficulties of the Russian army's position, and  i idly imagined what awaited it and the part he would ha e to play.

In oluntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a week's time he might, perhaps, see and take part in the first Russian encounter with the French since Su oro  met them.

He feared that Bonaparte's genius might outweigh all the courage of the Russian troops, and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced.

Excited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward his room to write to his father, to whom he wrote e ery day.

In the corridor he met Nes itski, with whom he shared a room, and the wag Zherko   they were as usual laughing.

"Why are you so glum?" asked Nes itski noticing Prince Andrew's pale face and glittering eyes.

"There's nothing to be gay about," answered Bolkonski.

Just as Prince Andrew met Nes itski and Zherko , there came toward them from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian general who on Kutuzo 's staff in charge of the pro isioning of the Russian army, and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arri ed the pre ious e ening.

There was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the three officers quite easily, but Zherko , pushing Nes itski aside with his arm, said in a breathless  oice,

"They're coming!... they're coming!... Stand aside, make way, please make way!"

The generals were passing by, looking as if they wished to a oid embarrassing attentions.

On the face of the wag Zherko  there suddenly appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress.

"Your excellency," said he in German, stepping forward and addressing the Austrian general, "I ha e the honor to congratulate you."

He bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the other, awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.

The member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him se erely but, seeing the seriousness of his stupid smile, could not but gi e him a moment's attention.

He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening.

"I ha e the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has arri ed, quite well, only a little bruised just here," he added, pointing with a beaming smile to his head.

The general frowned, turned away, and went on.

"Gott, wie nai !"   said he angrily, after he had gone a few steps.   "Good God, what simplicity!"

Nes itski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but Bolkonski, turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and turned to Zherko .

The ner ous irritation aroused by the appearance of Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the Russian army found  ent in anger at Zherko 's untimely jest.

"If you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of yourself," he said sharply, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, "I can't pre ent your doing so  but I warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence, I will teach you to beha e yourself."

Nes itski and Zherko  were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed at Bolkonski silently with wide open eyes.

"What's the matter? I only congratulated them," said Zherko .

"I am not jesting with you  please be silent!" cried Bolkonski, and taking Nes itski's arm he left Zherko , who did not know what to say.

"Come, what's the matter, old fellow?" said Nes itski trying to soothe him.

"What's the matter?" exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in his excitement. "Don't you understand that either we are officers ser ing our Tsar and our country, rejoicing in the successes and grie ing at the misfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely lackeys who care nothing for their master's business.

Quarante mille hommes massacres et l'armee de nos allies detruite, et  ous trou ez la le mot pour rire,"   he said, as if strengthening his  iews by this French sentence. "C'est bien pour un garcon de rien comme cet indi idu dont  ous a ez fait un ami, mais pas pour  ous, pas pour  ous.  (2) Only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this way," he added in Russian     but pronouncing the word with a French accent     ha ing noticed that Zherko  could still hear him.   "Forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyed, and you find that a cause for jesting!"

  (2) "It is all  ery well for that good for nothing fellow of whom you ha e made a friend, but not for you, not for you."

He waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, but he turned and went out of the corridor.

CHAPTER I 

The Pa lograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau.

The squadron in which Nicholas Rosto  ser ed as a cadet was quartered in the German  illage of Salzeneck.

The best quarters in the  illage were assigned to ca alry captain Deniso , the squadron commander, known throughout the whole ca alry di ision as  aska Deniso .

Cadet Rosto , e er since he had o ertaken the regiment in Poland, had li ed with the squadron commander.

On October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters o er the news of Mack's defeat, the camp life of the officers of this squadron was proceeding as usual.

Deniso , who had been losing at cards all night, had not yet come home when Rosto  rode back early in the morning from a foraging expedition.

Rosto  in his cadet uniform, with a jerk to his horse, rode up to the porch, swung his leg o er the saddle with a supple youthful mo ement, stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse, and at last sprang down and called to his orderly.

"Ah, Bondarenko, dear friend!" said he to the hussar who rushed up headlong to the horse. "Walk him up and down, my dear fellow," he continued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young people show to e eryone when they are happy.

"Yes, your excellency," answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his head.

"Mind, walk him up and down well!"

Another hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondarenko had already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle o er the horse's head.

It was e ident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to ser e him.

Rosto  patted the horse's neck and then his flank, and lingered for a moment.

"Splendid!

What a horse he will be!" he thought with a smile, and holding up his saber, his spurs jingling, he ran up the steps of the porch.

His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfork in hand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his face immediately brightened on seeing Rosto .

"Schon gut Morgen!

Schon gut Morgen!"   he said winking with a merry smile, e idently pleased to greet the young man.   "A  ery good morning! A  ery good morning!"

"Schon fleissig?"   said Rosto  with the same gay brotherly smile which did not lea e his eager face. "Hoch Oestreicher!

Hoch Russen!

Kaiser Alexander hoch!"  (2) said he, quoting words often repeated by the German landlord.   "Busy already?"   (2) "Hurrah for the Austrians!

Hurrah for the Russians!

Hurrah for Emperor Alexander!" The German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his cap, and wa ing it abo e his head cried 

"Und die ganze Welt hoch!"  

  "And hurrah for the whole world!"

Rosto  wa ed his cap abo e his head like the German and cried laughing,

"Und  i at die ganze Welt!"

Though neither the German cleaning his cowshed nor Rosto  back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any reason for rejoicing, they looked at each other with joyful delight and brotherly lo e, wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection, and parted smiling, the German returning to his cowshed and Rosto  going to the cottage he occupied with Deniso .

"What about your master?" he asked La rushka, Deniso 's orderly, whom all the regiment knew for a rogue.

"Hasn't been in since the e ening.

Must ha e been losing," answered La rushka. "I know by now, if he wins he comes back early to brag about it, but if he stays out till morning it means he's lost and will come back in a rage.

Will you ha e coffee?"

"Yes, bring some."

Ten minutes later La rushka brought the coffee.

"He's coming!" said he. "Now for trouble!" Rosto  looked out of the window and saw Deniso  coming home.

Deniso  was a small man with a red face, sparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair.

He wore an unfastened cloak, wide breeches hanging down in creases, and a crumpled shako on the back of his head.

He came up to the porch gloomily, hanging his head.

"La wuska!" he shouted loudly and angrily, "take it off, blockhead!"

"Well, I am taking it off," replied La rushka's  oice.

"Ah, you're up already," said Deniso , entering the room.

"Long ago," answered Rosto , "I ha e already been for the hay, and ha e seen Fraulein Mathilde."

"Weally!

And I' e been losing, bwother. I lost yesterday like a damned fool!" cried Deniso , not pronouncing his r's. "Such ill luck!

Such ill luck.

As soon as you left, it began and went on.

Hullo there! Tea!"

Puckering up his face though smiling, and showing his short strong teeth, he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick tangled black hair.

"And what de il made me go to that wat?" (an officer nicknamed "the rat") he said, rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands. "Just fancy, he didn't let me win a single cahd, not one cahd."

He took the lighted pipe that was offered to him, gripped it in his fist, and tapped it on the floor, making the sparks fly, while he continued to shout.

"He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it  gi es the singles and snatches the doubles!"

He scattered the burning tobacco, smashed the pipe, and threw it away.

Then he remained silent for a while, and all at once looked cheerfully with his glittering, black eyes at Rosto .

"If at least we had some women here  but there's nothing foh one to do but dwink.

If we could only get to fighting soon.

Hullo, who's there?" he said, turning to the door as he heard a tread of hea y boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop, and a respectful cough.

"The squadron quartermaster!" said La rushka.

Deniso 's face puckered still more.

"Wetched!" he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold in it. "Wosto , deah fellow, just see how much there is left and sho e the purse undah the pillow," he said, and went out to the quartermaster.

Rosto  took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new coins in separate piles, began counting them.

"Ah!

Telyanin!

How d'ye do?

They plucked me last night," came Deniso 's  oice from the next room.

"Where?

At Byko 's, at the rat's... I knew it," replied a piping  oice, and Lieutenant Telyanin, a small officer of the same squadron, entered the room.

Rosto  thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand which was offered him.

Telyanin for some reason had been transferred from the Guards just before this campaign.

He beha ed  ery well in the regiment but was not liked  Rosto  especially detested him and was unable to o ercome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man.

"Well, young ca alryman, how is my Rook beha ing?" he asked. (Rook was a young horse Telyanin had sold to Rosto .)

The lieutenant ne er looked the man he was speaking to straight in the face  his eyes continually wandered from one object to another.

"I saw you riding this morning..." he added.

"Oh, he's all right, a good horse," answered Rosto , though the horse for which he had paid se en hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum. "He's begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg," he added. "The hoof's cracked!

That's nothing.

I'll teach you what to do and show you what kind of ri et to use."

"Yes, please do," said Rosto .

"I'll show you, I'll show you! It's not a secret.

And it's a horse you'll thank me for."

"Then I'll ha e it brought round," said Rosto  wishing to a oid Telyanin, and he went out to gi e the order.

In the passage Deniso , with a pipe, was squatting on the threshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him.

On seeing Rosto , Deniso  screwed up his face and pointing o er his shoulder with his thumb to the room where Telyanin was sitting, he frowned and ga e a shudder of disgust.

"Ugh! I don't like that fellow," he said, regardless of the quartermaster's presence.

Rosto  shrugged his shoulders as much as to say 

"Nor do I, but what's one to do?" and, ha ing gi en his order, he returned to Telyanin.

Telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rosto  had left him, rubbing his small white hands.

"Well there certainly are disgusting people," thought Rosto  as he entered.

"Ha e you told them to bring the horse?" asked Telyanin, getting up and looking carelessly about him.

"I ha e."

"Let us go oursel es.

I only came round to ask Deniso  about yesterday's order.

Ha e you got it, Deniso ?"

"Not yet.

But where are you off to?"

"I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse," said Telyanin.

They went through the porch and into the stable.

The lieutenant explained how to ri et the hoof and went away to his own quarters.

When Rosto  went back there was a bottle of  odka and a sausage on the table.

Deniso  was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of paper.

He looked gloomily in Rosto 's face and said 

"I am witing to her."

He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and, e idently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to write, told Rosto  the contents of his letter.

"You see, my fwiend," he said, "we sleep when we don't lo e.

We are childwen of the dust... but one falls in lo e and one is a God, one is pua' as on the first day of cweation... Who's that now?

Send him to the de il, I'm busy!" he shouted to La rushka, who went up to him not in the least abashed.

"Who should it be?

You yourself told him to come.

It's the quartermaster for the money."

Deniso  frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped.

"Wetched business," he muttered to himself. "How much is left in the puhse?" he asked, turning to Rosto .

"Se en new and three old imperials."

"Oh, it's wetched!

Well, what are you standing there for, you sca'cwow? Call the quahtehmasteh," he shouted to La rushka.

"Please, Deniso , let me lend you some  I ha e some, you know," said Rosto , blushing.

"Don't like bowwowing from my own fellows, I don't," growled Deniso .

"But if you won't accept money from me like a comrade, you will offend me.

Really I ha e some," Rosto  repeated.

"No, I tell you."

And Deniso  went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow.

"Where ha e you put it, Wosto ?"

"Under the lower pillow."

"It's not there."

Deniso  threw both pillows on the floor.

The purse was not there.

"That's a miwacle."

"Wait, ha en't you dropped it?" said Rosto , picking up the pillows one at a time and shaking them.

He pulled off the quilt and shook it.

The purse was not there.

"Dear me, can I ha e forgotten?

No, I remember thinking that you kept it under your head like a treasure," said Rosto . "I put it just here.

Where is it?" he asked, turning to La rushka.

"I ha en't been in the room.

It must be where you put it."

"But it isn't?..."

"You're always like that  you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it.

Feel in your pockets."

"No, if I hadn't thought of it being a treasure," said Rosto , "but I remember putting it there."

La rushka turned all the bedding o er, looked under the bed and under the table, searched e erywhere, and stood still in the middle of the room.

Deniso  silently watched La rushka's mo ements, and when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found Deniso  glanced at Rosto .

"Wosto , you' e not been playing schoolboy twicks..."

Rosto  felt Deniso 's gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and instantly dropped them again.

All the blood which had seemed congested somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes.

He could not draw breath.

"And there hasn't been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and yoursel es.

It must be here somewhere," said La rushka.

"Now then, you de il's puppet, look ali e and hunt for it!" shouted Deniso , suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening gesture. "If the purse isn't found I'll flog you, I'll flog you all."

Rosto , his eyes a oiding Deniso , began buttoning his coat, buckled on his saber, and put on his cap.

"I must ha e that purse, I tell you," shouted Deniso , shaking his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall.

"Deniso , let him alone, I know who has taken it," said Rosto , going toward the door without raising his eyes.

Deniso  paused, thought a moment, and, e idently understanding what Rosto  hinted at, seized his arm.

"Nonsense!" he cried, and the  eins on his forehead and neck stood out like cords. "You are mad, I tell you. I won't allow it. The purse is here!

I'll flay this scoundwel ali e, and it will be found."

"I know who has taken it," repeated Rosto  in an unsteady  oice, and went to the door.

"And I tell you, don't you dahe to do it!" shouted Deniso , rushing at the cadet to restrain him.

But Rosto  pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though Deniso  were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face.

"Do you understand what you're saying?" he said in a trembling  oice. "There was no one else in the room except myself.

So that if it is not so, then..."

He could not finish, and ran out of the room.

"Ah, may the de il take you and e ewybody," were the last words Rosto  heard.

Rosto  went to Telyanin's quarters.

"The master is not in, he's gone to headquarters," said Telyanin's orderly. "Has something happened?" he added, surprised at the cadet's troubled face.

"No, nothing."

"You' e only just missed him," said the orderly.

The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and Rosto , without returning home, took a horse and rode there.

There was an inn in the  illage which the officers frequented.

Rosto  rode up to it and saw Telyanin's horse at the porch.

In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting o er a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine.

"Ah, you' e come here too, young man!" he said, smiling and raising his eyebrows.

"Yes," said Rosto  as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word  and he sat down at the nearest table.

Both were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the room.

No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of kni es and the munching of the lieutenant.

When Telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double purse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white, turned up fingers, drew out a gold imperial, and lifting his eyebrows ga e it to the waiter.

"Please be quick," he said.

The coin was a new one.

Rosto  rose and went up to Telyanin.

"Allow me to look at your purse," he said in a low, almost inaudible,  oice.

With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Telyanin handed him the purse.

"Yes, it's a nice purse. Yes, yes," he said, growing suddenly pale, and added, "Look at it, young man."

Rosto  took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in it, and looked at Telyanin.

The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow  ery merry.

"If we get to  ienna I'll get rid of it there but in these wretched little towns there's nowhere to spend it," said he. "Well, let me ha e it, young man, I'm going."

Rosto  did not speak.

"And you? Are you going to ha e lunch too?

They feed you quite decently here," continued Telyanin. "Now then, let me ha e it."

He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse.

Rosto  let go of it.

Telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open, as if to say, "Yes, yes, I am putting my purse in my pocket and that's quite simple and is no one else's business."

"Well, young man?" he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted brows he glanced into Rosto 's eyes.

Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyanin's eyes to Rosto 's and back, and back again and again in an instant.

"Come here," said Rosto , catching hold of Telyanin's arm and almost dragging him to the window. "That money is Deniso 's  you took it..." he whispered just abo e Telyanin's ear.

"What? What? How dare you?

What?" said Telyanin.

But these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an entreaty for pardon.

As soon as Rosto  heard them, an enormous load of doubt fell from him.

He was glad, and at the same instant began to pity the miserable man who stood before him, but the task he had begun had to be completed.

"Hea en only knows what the people here may imagine," muttered Telyanin, taking up his cap and mo ing toward a small empty room. "We must ha e an explanation..."

"I know it and shall pro e it," said Rosto .

"I..."

E ery muscle of Telyanin's pale, terrified face began to qui er, his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising to Rosto 's face, and his sobs were audible.

"Count!... Don't ruin a young fellow... here is this wretched money, take it..." He threw it on the table. "I ha e an old father and mother!..."

Rosto  took the money, a oiding Telyanin's eyes, and went out of the room without a word.

But at the door he stopped and then retraced his steps. "O God," he said with tears in his eyes, "how could you do it?"

"Count..." said Telyanin drawing nearer to him.

"Don't touch me," said Rosto , drawing back. "If you need it, take the money," and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn.

CHAPTER  

That same e ening there was an animated discussion among the squadron's officers in Deniso 's quarters.

"And I tell you, Rosto , that you must apologize to the colonel!" said a tall, grizzly haired staff captain, with enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features, to Rosto  who was crimson with excitement.

The staff captain, Kirsten, had twice been reduced to the ranks for affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission.

"I will allow no one to call me a liar!" cried Rosto . "He told me I lied, and I told him he lied.

And there it rests.

He may keep me on duty e ery day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make me apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it beneath his dignity to gi e me satisfaction, then..."

"You just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen," interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache. "You tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen..."

"I'm not to blame that the con ersation began in the presence of other officers.

Perhaps I ought not to ha e spoken before them, but I am not a diplomatist.

That's why I joined the hussars, thinking that here one would not need finesse  and he tells me that I am lying     so let him gi e me satisfaction..."

"That's all right. No one thinks you a coward, but that's not the point.

Ask Deniso  whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander?"

Deniso  sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the con ersation, e idently with no wish to take part in it.

He answered the staff captain's question by a disappro ing shake of his head.

"You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other officers," continued the staff captain, "and Bogdanich" (the colonel was called Bogdanich) "shuts you up."

"He did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth."

"Well, ha e it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must apologize."

"Not on any account!" exclaimed Rosto .

"I did not expect this of you," said the staff captain seriously and se erely. "You don't wish to apologize, but, man, it's not only to him but to the whole regiment     all of us     you're to blame all round.

The case is this  you ought to ha e thought the matter o er and taken ad ice  but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers.

Now what was the colonel to do?

Ha e the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment?

Disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel?

Is that how you look at it?

We don't see it like that.

And Bogdanich was a brick  he told you you were saying what was not true.

It's not pleasant, but what's to be done, my dear fellow?

You landed yourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth the thing o er, some conceit pre ents your apologizing, and you wish to make the whole affair public.

You are offended at being put on duty a bit, but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer?

Whate er Bogdanich may be, anyway he is an honorable and bra e old colonel! You're quick at taking offense, but you don't mind disgracing the whole regiment!" The staff captain's  oice began to tremble. "You ha e been in the regiment next to no time, my lad, you're here today and tomorrow you'll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said 'There are thie es among the Pa lograd officers!'

But it's not all the same to us!

Am I not right, Deniso ?

It's not the same!"

Deniso  remained silent and did not mo e, but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at Rosto .

"You  alue your own pride and don't wish to apologize," continued the staff captain, "but we old fellows, who ha e grown up in and, God willing, are going to die in the regiment, we prize the honor of the regiment, and Bogdanich knows it.

Oh, we do prize it, old fellow!

And all this is not right, it's not right!

You may take offense or not but I always stick to mother truth.

It's not right!"

And the staff captain rose and turned away from Rosto .

"That's twue, de il take it!" shouted Deniso , jumping up. "Now then, Wosto , now then!"

Rosto , growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one officer and then at the other.

"No, gentlemen, no... you mustn't think... I quite understand. You're wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor of the regiment I'd... Ah well, I'll show that in action, and for me the honor of the flag... Well, ne er mind, it's true I'm to blame, to blame all round. Well, what else do you want?..."

"Come, that's right, Count!" cried the staff captain, turning round and clapping Rosto  on the shoulder with his big hand.

"I tell you," shouted Deniso , "he's a fine fellow."

"That's better, Count," said the staff captain, beginning to address Rosto  by his title, as if in recognition of his confession. "Go and apologize, your excellency. Yes, go!"

"Gentlemen, I'll do anything. No one shall hear a word from me," said Rosto  in an imploring  oice, "but I can't apologize, by God I can't, do what you will!

How can I go and apologize like a little boy asking forgi eness?"

Deniso  began to laugh.

"It'll be worse for you.

Bogdanich is  indicti e and you'll pay for your obstinacy," said Kirsten.

"No, on my word it's not obstinacy!

I can't describe the feeling. I can't..."

"Well, it's as you like," said the staff captain. "And what has become of that scoundrel?" he asked Deniso .

"He has weported himself sick, he's to be stwuck off the list tomowwow," muttered Deniso .

"It is an illness, there's no other way of explaining it," said the staff captain.

"Illness or not, he'd better not cwoss my path. I'd kill him!" shouted Deniso  in a bloodthirsty tone.

Just then Zherko  entered the room.

"What brings you here?" cried the officers turning to the newcomer.

"We're to go into action, gentlemen!

Mack has surrendered with his whole army."

"It's not true!"

"I' e seen him myself!"

"What?

Saw the real Mack? With hands and feet?"

"Into action!

Into action!

Bring him a bottle for such news!

But how did you come here?"

"I' e been sent back to the regiment all on account of that de il, Mack.

An Austrian general complained of me.

I congratulated him on Mack's arri al... What's the matter, Rosto ? You look as if you'd just come out of a hot bath."

"Oh, my dear fellow, we're in such a stew here these last two days."

The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by Zherko .

They were under orders to ad ance next day.

"We're going into action, gentlemen!"

"Well, thank God! We' e been sitting here too long!"

CHAPTER  I

Kutuzo  fell back toward  ienna, destroying behind him the bridges o er the ri ers Inn (at Braunau) and Traun (near Linz).

On October 23 the Russian troops were crossing the ri er Enns.

At midday the Russian baggage train, the artillery, and columns of troops were defiling through the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge.

It was a warm, rainy, autumnal day.

The wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the bridge was at times  eiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far distant objects could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly  arnished.

Down below, the little town could be seen with its white, red roofed houses, its cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of Russian troops.

At the bend of the Danube,  essels, an island, and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the Enns and the Danube became  isible, and the rocky left bank of the Danube co ered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges.

The turrets of a con ent stood out beyond a wild  irgin pine forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the enemy's horse patrols could be discerned.

Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the country through his fieldglass.

A little behind them Nes itski, who had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting on the trail of a gun carriage.

A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a flask, and Nes itski was treating some officers to pies and real doppelkummel.

The officers gladly gathered round him, some on their knees, some squatting Turkish fashion on the wet grass.

"Yes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool.

It's a fine place!

Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?" Nes itski was saying.

"Thank you  ery much, Prince," answered one of the officers, pleased to be talking to a staff officer of such importance. "It's a lo ely place!

We passed close to the park and saw two deer... and what a splendid house!"

"Look, Prince," said another, who would ha e dearly liked to take another pie but felt shy, and therefore pretended to be examining the countryside     "See, our infantrymen ha e already got there.

Look there in the meadow behind the  illage, three of them are dragging something. They'll ransack that castle," he remarked with e ident appro al.

"So they will," said Nes itski. "No, but what I should like," added he, munching a pie in his moist lipped handsome mouth, "would be to slip in o er there."

He pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes narrowed and gleamed.

"That would be fine, gentlemen!"

The officers laughed.

"Just to flutter the nuns a bit.

They say there are Italian girls among them.

On my word I'd gi e fi e years of my life for it!"

"They must be feeling dull, too," said one of the bolder officers, laughing.

Meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to the general, who looked through his field glass.

"Yes, so it is, so it is," said the general angrily, lowering the field glass and shrugging his shoulders, "so it is! They'll be fired on at the crossing.

And why are they dawdling there?"

On the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye, and from their battery a milk white cloud arose.

Then came the distant report of a shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing.

Nes itski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.

"Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?" he said.

"It's a bad business," said the general without answering him, "our men ha e been wasting time."

"Hadn't I better ride o er, your excellency?" asked Nes itski.

"Yes, please do," answered the general, and he repeated the order that had already once been gi en in detail  "and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered  and the inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected."

" ery good," answered Nes itski.

He called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the knapsack and flask, and swung his hea y person easily into the saddle.

"I'll really call in on the nuns," he said to the officers who watched him smilingly, and he rode off by the winding path down the hill.

"Now then, let's see how far it will carry, Captain. Just try!" said the general, turning to an artillery officer. "Ha e a little fun to pass the time."

"Crew, to your guns!" commanded the officer.

In a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began loading.

"One!" came the command.

Number one jumped briskly aside.

The gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew abo e the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little smoke showing the spot where it burst.

The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. E eryone got up and began watching the mo ements of our troops below, as plainly  isible as if but a stone's throw away, and the mo ements of the approaching enemy farther off.

At the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds, and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression.

CHAPTER  II

Two of the enemy's shots had already flown across the bridge, where there was a crush.

Halfway across stood Prince Nes itski, who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the railings.

He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles.

Each time Prince Nes itski tried to mo e on, soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him against the railings, and all he could do was to smile.

"What a fine fellow you are, friend!" said the Cossack to a con oy soldier with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were crowded together close to his wheels and his horses. "What a fellow!

You can't wait a moment! Don't you see the general wants to pass?"

But the con oyman took no notice of the word "general" and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking his way. "Hi there, boys! Keep to the left! Wait a bit." But the soldiers, crowded together shoulder to shoulder, their bayonets interlocking, mo ed o er the bridge in a dense mass.

Looking down o er the rails Prince Nes itski saw the rapid, noisy little wa es of the Enns, which rippling and eddying round the piles of the bridge chased each other along.

Looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform li ing wa es of soldiers, shoulder straps, co ered shakos, knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with broad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and listless tired expressions, and feet that mo ed through the sticky mud that co ered the planks of the bridge.

Sometimes through the monotonous wa es of men, like a fleck of white foam on the wa es of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men, squeezed his way along  sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the ri er, an hussar on foot, an orderly, or a townsman was carried through the wa es of infantry  and sometimes like a log floating down the ri er, an officers' or company's baggage wagon, piled high, leather co ered, and hemmed in on all sides, mo ed across the bridge.

"It's as if a dam had burst," said the Cossack hopelessly. "Are there many more of you to come?"

"A million all but one!" replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat, with a wink, and passed on followed by another, an old man.

"If he" (he meant the enemy) "begins popping at the bridge now," said the old soldier dismally to a comrade, "you'll forget to scratch yourself."

That soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a cart.

"Where the de il ha e the leg bands been sho ed to?" said an orderly, running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it.

And he also passed on with the wagon.

Then came some merry soldiers who had e idently been drinking.

"And then, old fellow, he gi es him one in the teeth with the butt end of his gun..." a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily, with a wide swing of his arm.

"Yes, the ham was just delicious..." answered another with a loud laugh.

And they, too, passed on, so that Nes itski did not learn who had been struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it.

"Bah! How they scurry. He just sends a ball and they think they'll all be killed," a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully.

"As it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean," said a young soldier with an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, "I felt like dying of fright.

I did, 'pon my word, I got that frightened!" said he, as if bragging of ha ing been frightened.

That one also passed.

Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before.

It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German, and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects. A fine brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind.

A woman with an unweaned baby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds.

E idently these fugiti es were allowed to pass by special permission.

The eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the women, and while the  ehicle was passing at foot pace all the soldiers' remarks related to the two young ones.

E ery face bore almost the same smile, expressing unseemly thoughts about the women.

"Just see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!"

"Sell me the missis," said another soldier, addressing the German, who, angry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast eyes.

"See how smart she's made herself!

Oh, the de ils!"

"There, Fedoto , you should be quartered on them!"

"I ha e seen as much before now, mate!"

"Where are you going?" asked an infantry officer who was eating an apple, also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl.

The German closed his eyes, signifying that he did not understand.

"Take it if you like," said the officer, gi ing the girl an apple.

The girl smiled and took it.

Nes itski like the rest of the men on the bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed.

When they had gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with the same kind of talk, and at last all stopped.

As often happens, the horses of a con oy wagon became resti e at the end of the bridge, and the whole crowd had to wait.

"And why are they stopping?

There's no proper order!" said the soldiers. "Where are you sho ing to?

De il take you!

Can't you wait?

It'll be worse if he fires the bridge.

See, here's an officer jammed in too"     different  oices were saying in the crowd, as the men looked at one another, and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge.

Looking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge, Nes itski suddenly heard a sound new to him, of something swiftly approaching... something big, that splashed into the water.

"Just see where it carries to!" a soldier near by said sternly, looking round at the sound.

"Encouraging us to get along quicker," said another uneasily.

The crowd mo ed on again.

Nes itski realized that it was a cannon ball.

"Hey, Cossack, my horse!" he said. "Now, then, you there! get out of the way! Make way!"

With great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting continually he mo ed on.

The soldiers squeezed themsel es to make way for him, but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg, and those nearest him were not to blame for they were themsel es pressed still harder from behind.

"Nes itski, Nes itski! you numskull!" came a hoarse  oice from behind him.

Nes itski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but separated by the li ing mass of mo ing infantry,  aska Deniso , red and shaggy, with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily o er his shoulder.

"Tell these de ils, these fiends, to let me pass!" shouted Deniso  e idently in a fit of rage, his coal black eyes with their bloodshot whites glittering and rolling as he wa ed his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as red as his face.

"Ah,  aska!" joyfully replied Nes itski. "What's up with you?"

"The squadwon can't pass," shouted  aska Deniso , showing his white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting white foam from his bit, tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs, and apparently ready to jump o er the railings had his rider let him. "What is this? They're like sheep! Just like sheep!

Out of the way!... Let us pass!... Stop there, you de il with the cart!

I'll hack you with my saber!" he shouted, actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and flourishing it.

The soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and Deniso  joined Nes itski.

"How's it you're not drunk today?" said Nes itski when the other had ridden up to him.

"They don't e en gi e one time to dwink!" answered  aska Deniso . "They keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day.

If they mean to fight, let's fight.

But the de il knows what this is."

"What a dandy you are today!" said Nes itski, looking at Deniso 's new cloak and saddlecloth.

Deniso  smiled, took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused a smell of perfume, and put it to Nes itski's nose.

"Of course. I'm going into action! I' e sha ed, bwushed my teeth, and scented myself."

The imposing figure of Nes itski followed by his Cossack, and the determination of Deniso  who flourished his sword and shouted frantically, had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry.

Beside the bridge Nes itski found the colonel to whom he had to deli er the order, and ha ing done this he rode back.

Ha ing cleared the way Deniso  stopped at the end of the bridge.

Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the ground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw nearer.

Then the clang of hoofs, as of se eral horses galloping, resounded on the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in front and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it.

The infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill will, estrangement, and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually encounter one another at the clean, smart hussars who mo ed past them in regular order.

"Smart lads!

Only fit for a fair!" said one.

"What good are they?

They're led about just for show!" remarked another.

"Don't kick up the dust, you infantry!" jested an hussar whose prancing horse had splashed mud o er some foot soldiers.

"I'd like to put you on a two days' march with a knapsack! Your fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed," said an infantryman, wiping the mud off his face with his slee e. "Perched up there, you're more like a bird than a man."

"There now, Zikin, they ought to put you on a horse. You'd look fine," said a corporal, chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the weight of his knapsack.

"Take a stick between your legs, that'll suit you for a horse!" the hussar shouted back.

CHAPTER  III

The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel.

At last the baggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last battalion came onto the bridge.

Only Deniso 's squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy, who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet  isible from the bridge, for the horizon as seen from the  alley through which the ri er flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away.

At the foot of the hill lay wasteland o er which a few groups of our Cossack scouts were mo ing.

Suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground, artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen.

These were the French.

A group of Cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot.

All the officers and men of Deniso 's squadron, though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions, thought only of what was there on the hilltop, and kept constantly looking at the patches appearing on the skyline, which they knew to be the enemy's troops.

The weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly upon the Danube and the dark hills around it.

It was calm, and at inter als the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill.

There was no one now between the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers.

An empty space of some se en hundred yards was all that separated them.

The enemy ceased firing, and that stern, threatening, inaccessible, and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt.

"One step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line di iding the li ing from the dead lies uncertainty, suffering, and death.

And what is there? Who is there?     there beyond that field, that tree, that roof lit up by the sun?

No one knows, but one wants to know. You fear and yet long to cross that line, and know that sooner or later it must be crossed and you will ha e to find out what is there, just as you will ine itably ha e to learn what lies the other side of death.

But you are strong, healthy, cheerful, and excited, and are surrounded by other such excitedly animated and healthy men."

So thinks, or at any rate feels, anyone who comes in sight of the enemy, and that feeling gi es a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to e erything that takes place at such moments.

On the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon rose, and a ball flew whistling o er the heads of the hussar squadron.

The officers who had been standing together rode off to their places.

The hussars began carefully aligning their horses.

Silence fell on the whole squadron.

All were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander, awaiting the word of command.

A second and a third cannon ball flew past.

E idently they were firing at the hussars, but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew o er the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them.

The hussars did not look round, but at the sound of each shot, as at the word of command, the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different, holding its breath while the ball flew past, rose in the stirrups and sank back again.

The soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one another, curious to see their comrades' impression.

E ery face, from Deniso 's to that of the bugler, showed one common expression of conflict, irritation, and excitement, around chin and mouth.

The quartermaster frowned, looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them.

Cadet Mirono  ducked e ery time a ball flew past.

Rosto  on the left flank, mounted on his Rook     a handsome horse despite its game leg     had the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he will distinguish himself.

He was glancing at e eryone with a clear, bright expression, as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under fire.

But despite himself, on his face too that same indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth.

"Who's that curtseying there?

Cadet Miwono !

That's not wight! Look at me," cried Deniso  who, unable to keep still on one spot, kept turning his horse in front of the squadron.

The black, hairy, snub nosed face of  aska Deniso , and his whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually did, especially toward e ening when he had emptied his second bottle  he was only redder than usual.

With his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle, he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse  oice to the men to look to their pistols.

He rode up to Kirsten.

The staff captain on his broad backed, steady mare came at a walk to meet him.

His face with its long mustache was serious as always, only his eyes were brighter than usual.

"Well, what about it?" said he to Deniso . "It won't come to a fight.

You'll see     we shall retire."

"The de il only knows what they're about!" muttered Deniso .

"Ah, Wosto ," he cried noticing the cadet's bright face, "you' e got it at last."

And he smiled appro ingly, e idently pleased with the cadet.

Rosto  felt perfectly happy.

Just then the commander appeared on the bridge.

Deniso  galloped up to him.

"Your excellency! Let us attack them! I'll dwi e them off."

"Attack indeed!" said the colonel in a bored  oice, puckering up his face as if dri ing off a troublesome fly. "And why are you stopping here?

Don't you see the skirmishers are retreating?

Lead the squadron back."

The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without ha ing lost a single man.

The second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side of the ri er.

The two Pa lograd squadrons, ha ing crossed the bridge, retired up the hill one after the other.

Their colonel, Karl Bogdanich Schubert, came up to Deniso 's squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rosto , without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning Telyanin.

Rosto , feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the colonel's athletic back, his nape co ered with light hair, and his red neck.

It seemed to Rosto  that Bogdanich was only pretending not to notice him, and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet's courage, so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily  then it seemed to him that Bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage.

Next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish him     Rosto .

Then he imagined how, after the attack, Bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation.

The high shouldered figure of Zherko , familiar to the Pa lograds as he had but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel.

After his dismissal from headquarters Zherko  had not remained in the regiment, saying he was not such a fool as to sla e at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagration.

He now came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard.

"Colonel," he said, addressing Rosto 's enemy with an air of gloomy gra ity and glancing round at his comrades, "there is an order to stop and fire the bridge."

"An order to who?" asked the colonel morosely.

"I don't myself know 'to who,'" replied the cornet in a serious tone, "but the prince told me to 'go and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge.'"

Zherko  was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel of hussars with the same order.

After him the stout Nes itski came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight.

"How's this, Colonel?" he shouted as he approached. "I told you to fire the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered  they are all beside themsel es o er there and one can't make anything out."

The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nes itski.

"You spoke to me of inflammable material," said he, "but you said nothing about firing it."

"But, my dear sir," said Nes itski as he drew up, taking off his cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand, "wasn't I telling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material had been put in position?"

"I am not your 'dear sir,' Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell me to burn the bridge!

I know the ser ice, and it is my habit orders strictly to obey.

You said the bridge would be burned, but who would it burn, I could not know by the holy spirit!"

"Ah, that's always the way!" said Nes itski with a wa e of the hand. "How did you get here?" said he, turning to Zherko .

"On the same business.

But you are damp! Let me wring you out!"

"You were saying, Mr. Staff Officer..." continued the colonel in an offended tone.

"Colonel," interrupted the officer of the suite, "You must be quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot."

The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the stout staff officer, and at Zherko , and he frowned.

"I will the bridge fire," he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still do the right thing.

Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame for e erything, the colonel mo ed forward and ordered the second squadron, that in which Rosto  was ser ing under Deniso , to return to the bridge.

"There, it's just as I thought," said Rosto  to himself. "He wishes to test me!" His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face. "Let him see whether I am a coward!" he thought.

Again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression appeared that they had worn when under fire.

Rosto  watched his enemy, the colonel, closely     to find in his face confirmation of his own conjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at Rosto , and looked as he always did when at the front, solemn and stern.

Then came the word of command.

"Look sharp!

Look sharp!" se eral  oices repeated around him.

Their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the hussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do.

The men were crossing themsel es.

Rosto  no longer looked at the colonel, he had no time.

He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so much afraid that his heart stood still.

His hand trembled as he ga e his horse into an orderly's charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud.

Deniso  rode past him, leaning back and shouting something.

Rosto  saw nothing but the hussars running all around him, their spurs catching and their sabers clattering.

"Stretchers!" shouted someone behind him.

Rosto  did not think what this call for stretchers meant  he ran on, trying only to be ahead of the others  but just at the bridge, not looking at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud, stumbled, and fell on his hands.

The others outstripped him.

"At boss zides, Captain," he heard the  oice of the colonel, who, ha ing ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a triumphant, cheerful face.

Rosto  wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the front the better.

But Bogdanich, without looking at or recognizing Rosto , shouted to him 

"Who's that running on the middle of the bridge?

To the right!

Come back, Cadet!" he cried angrily  and turning to Deniso , who, showing off his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge 

"Why run risks, Captain?

You should dismount," he said.

"Oh, e ery bullet has its billet," answered  aska Deniso , turning in his saddle.

Meanwhile Nes itski, Zherko , and the officer of the suite were standing together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small group of men with yellow shakos, dark green jackets braided with cord, and blue riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side     the blue uniforms and groups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery.

"Will they burn the bridge or not?

Who'll get there first?

Will they get there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot range and wipe them out?"

These were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground abo e the bridge in oluntarily asked himself with a sinking heart     watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright e ening light and the blue tunics ad ancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns.

"Ugh. The hussars will get it hot!" said Nes itski  "they are within grapeshot range now."

"He shouldn't ha e taken so many men," said the officer of the suite.

"True enough," answered Nes itski  "two smart fellows could ha e done the job just as well."

"Ah, your excellency," put in Zherko , his eyes fixed on the hussars, but still with that nai e air that made it impossible to know whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest. "Ah, your excellency!

How you look at things!

Send two men? And who then would gi e us the  ladimir medal and ribbon?

But now, e en if they do get peppered, the squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon.

Our Bogdanich knows how things are done."

"There now!" said the officer of the suite, "that's grapeshot."

He pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being detached and hurriedly remo ed.

On the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of smoke appeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously, and at the moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen.

Then two reports one after another, and a third.

"Oh! Oh!" groaned Nes itski as if in fierce pain, seizing the officer of the suite by the arm. "Look! A man has fallen! Fallen, fallen!"

"Two, I think."

"If I were Tsar I would ne er go to war," said Nes itski, turning away.

The French guns were hastily reloaded.

The infantry in their blue uniforms ad anced toward the bridge at a run.

Smoke appeared again but at irregular inter als, and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge.

But this time Nes itski could not see what was happening there, as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it.

The hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire and the French batteries were now firing at them, no longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at.

The French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars got back to their horses.

Two were misdirected and the shot went too high, but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked three of them o er.

Rosto , absorbed by his relations with Bogdanich, had paused on the bridge not knowing what to do.

There was no one to hew down (as he had always imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the other soldiers.

He stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar nearest to him fell against the rails with a groan.

Rosto  ran up to him with the others.

Again someone shouted,

"Stretchers!"

Four men seized the hussar and began lifting him.

"Oooh! For Christ's sake let me alone!" cried the wounded man, but still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher.

Nicholas Rosto  turned away and, as if searching for something, gazed into the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, and at the sun.

How beautiful the sky looked  how blue, how calm, and how deep!

How bright and glorious was the setting sun!

With what soft glitter the waters of the distant Danube shone.

And fairer still were the faraway blue mountains beyond the ri er, the nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and the pine forests  eiled in the mist of their summits... There was peace and happiness...

"I should wish for nothing else, nothing, if only I were there," thought Rosto . "In myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness  but here... groans, suffering, fear, and this uncertainty and hurry... There     they are shouting again, and again are all running back somewhere, and I shall run with them, and it, death, is here abo e me and around... Another instant and I shall ne er again see the sun, this water, that gorge!..."

At that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, and other stretchers came into  iew before Rosto .

And the fear of death and of the stretchers, and lo e of the sun and of life, all merged into one feeling of sickening agitation.

"O Lord God!

Thou who art in that hea en, sa e, forgi e, and protect me!" Rosto  whispered.

The hussars ran back to the men who held their horses  their  oices sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight. "Well, fwiend?

So you' e smelt powdah!" shouted  aska Deniso  just abo e his ear.

"It's all o er  but I am a coward     yes, a coward!" thought Rosto , and sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting one foot, from the orderly and began to mount.

"Was that grapeshot?" he asked Deniso .

"Yes and no mistake!" cried Deniso .

"You worked like wegular bwicks and it's nasty work!

An attack's pleasant work! Hacking away at the dogs! But this sort of thing is the  ery de il, with them shooting at you like a target."

And Deniso  rode up to a group that had stopped near Rosto , composed of the colonel, Nes itski, Zherko , and the officer from the suite.

"Well, it seems that no one has noticed," thought Rosto .

And this was true. No one had taken any notice, for e eryone knew the sensation which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced.

"Here's something for you to report," said Zherko . "See if I don't get promoted to a sublieutenancy."

"Inform the prince that I the bridge fired!" said the colonel triumphantly and gaily.

"And if he asks about the losses?"

"A trifle," said the colonel in his bass  oice  "two hussars wounded, and one knocked out," he added, unable to restrain a happy smile, and pronouncing the phrase "knocked out" with ringing distinctness.

CHAPTER IX

Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command of Bonaparte, encountering a population that was unfriendly to it, losing confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies, and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen, the Russian army of thirty fi e thousand men commanded by Kutuzo  was hurriedly retreating along the Danube, stopping where o ertaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its hea y equipment.

There had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk  but despite the courage and endurance     acknowledged e en by the enemy     with which the Russians fought, the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat.

Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had joined Kutuzo  at Braunau now separated from the Russian army, and Kutuzo  was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces.

The defense of  ienna was no longer to be thought of.

Instead of an offensi e, the plan of which, carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics, had been handed to Kutuzo  when he was in  ienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were ad ancing from Russia, without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm.

On the twenty eighth of October Kutuzo  with his army crossed to the left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time with the ri er between himself and the main body of the French.

On the thirtieth he attacked Mortier's di ision, which was on the left bank, and broke it up.

In this action for the first time trophies were taken  banners, cannon, and two enemy generals.

For the first time, after a fortnight's retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held the field but had repulsed the French.

Though the troops were ill clad, exhausted, and had lost a third of their number in killed, wounded, sick, and stragglers  though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter in which Kutuzo  entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy  and though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems con erted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded, yet the stand made at Krems and the  ictory o er Mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably.

Throughout the whole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from Russia, of some  ictory gained by the Austrians, and of the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte.

Prince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the Austrian General Schmidt, who was killed in the action.

His horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet.

As a mark of the commander in chief's special fa or he was sent with the news of this  ictory to the Austrian court, now no longer at  ienna (which was threatened by the French) but at Brunn.

Despite his apparently delicate build Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many  ery muscular men, and on the night of the battle, ha ing arri ed at Krems excited but not weary, with dispatches from Dokhturo  to Kutuzo , he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to Brunn.

To be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion.

The night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that had fallen the pre ious day     the day of the battle.

Re iewing his impressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a  ictory would create, or recalling the send off gi en him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers, Prince Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a long desired happiness.

As soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of  ictory.

Then he began to imagine that the Russians were running away and that he himself was killed, but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away.

He again recalled all the details of the  ictory and his own calm courage during the battle, and feeling reassured he dozed off.... The dark starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning.

The snow was thawing in the sunshine, the horses galloped quickly, and on both sides of the road were forests of different kinds, fields, and  illages.

At one of the post stations he o ertook a con oy of Russian wounded.

The Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front cart, shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse.

In each of the long German carts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged men were being jolted o er the stony road.

Some of them were talking (he heard Russian words), others were eating bread  the more se erely wounded looked silently, with the languid interest of sick children, at the en oy hurrying past them.

Prince Andrew told his dri er to stop, and asked a soldier in what action they had been wounded.

"Day before yesterday, on the Danube," answered the soldier.

Prince Andrew took out his purse and ga e the soldier three gold pieces.

"That's for them all," he said to the officer who came up. "Get well soon, lads!" he continued, turning to the soldiers. "There's plenty to do still."

"What news, sir?" asked the officer, e idently anxious to start a con ersation.

"Good news!...

Go on!" he shouted to the dri er, and they galloped on.

It was already quite dark when Prince Andrew rattled o er the pa ed streets of Brunn and found himself surrounded by high buildings, the lights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine carriages, and all that atmosphere of a large and acti e town which is always so attracti e to a soldier after camp life.

Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night, Prince Andrew when he dro e up to the palace felt e en more  igorous and alert than he had done the day before.

Only his eyes gleamed fe erishly and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity.

He again  i idly recalled the details of the battle, no longer dim, but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself stating them to the Emperor Francis.

He  i idly imagined the casual questions that might be put to him and the answers he would gi e. He expected to be at once presented to the Emperor.

At the chief entrance to the palace, howe er, an official came running out to meet him, and learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance.

"To the right from the corridor, Euer Hochgeboren! There you will find the adjutant on duty," said the official. "He will conduct you to the Minister of War."

The adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew, asked him to wait, and went in to the Minister of War.

Fi e minutes later he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along a corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work.

The adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any attempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger.

Prince Andrew's joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he approached the door of the minister's room.

He felt offended, and without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for.

His fertile mind instantly suggested to him a point of  iew which ga e him a right to despise the adjutant and the minister.

"Away from the smell of powder, they probably think it easy to gain  ictories!" he thought.

His eyes narrowed disdainfully, he entered the room of the Minister of War with peculiarly deliberate steps.

This feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them, and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arri al.

A wax candle stood at each side of the minister's bent bald head with its gray temples.

He went on reading to the end, without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps.

"Take this and deli er it," said he to his adjutant, handing him the papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger.

Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutuzo 's army interested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was concerned with, or he wanted to gi e the Russian special messenger that impression.

"But that is a matter of perfect indifference to me," he thought.

The minister drew the remaining papers together, arranged them e enly, and then raised his head.

He had an intellectual and distincti e head, but the instant he turned to Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent expression on his face changed in a way e idently deliberate and habitual to him. His face took on the stupid artificial smile (which does not e en attempt to hide its artificiality) of a man who is continually recei ing many petitioners one after another.

"From General Field Marshal Kutuzo ?" he asked. "I hope it is good news?

There has been an encounter with Mortier?

A  ictory?

It was high time!"

He took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it with a mournful expression.

"Oh, my God!

My God!

Schmidt!" he exclaimed in German. "What a calamity! What a calamity!"

Ha ing glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked at Prince Andrew, e idently considering something.

"Ah what a calamity!

You say the affair was decisi e?

But Mortier is not captured." Again he pondered. "I am  ery glad you ha e brought good news, though Schmidt's death is a hea y price to pay for the  ictory.

His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today.

I thank you! You must ha e a rest.

Be at the le ee tomorrow after the parade.

Howe er, I will let you know."

The stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking, reappeared.

"Au re oir! Thank you  ery much.

His Majesty will probably desire to see you," he added, bowing his head.

When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and happiness the  ictory had afforded him had been now left in the indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant.

The whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed  the battle seemed the memory of a remote e ent long past.

CHAPTER X

Prince Andrew stayed at Brunn with Bilibin, a Russian acquaintance of his in the diplomatic ser ice.

"Ah, my dear prince! I could not ha e a more welcome  isitor," said Bilibin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew. "Franz, put the prince's things in my bedroom," said he to the ser ant who was ushering Bolkonski in. "So you're a messenger of  ictory, eh?

Splendid!

And I am sitting here ill, as you see."

After washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into the diplomat's luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him.

Bilibin settled down comfortably beside the fire.

After his journey and the campaign during which he had been depri ed of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life, Prince Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood.

Besides it was pleasant, after his reception by the Austrians, to speak if not in Russian (for they were speaking French) at least with a Russian who would, he supposed, share the general Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was then particularly strong.

Bilibin was a man of thirty fi e, a bachelor, and of the same circle as Prince Andrew.

They had known each other pre iously in Petersburg, but had become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in  ienna with Kutuzo .

Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who ga e promise of rising high in the military profession, so to an e en greater extent Bilibin ga e promise of rising in his diplomatic career.

He still a young man but no longer a young diplomat, as he had entered the ser ice at the age of sixteen, had been in Paris and Copenhagen, and now held a rather important post in  ienna.

Both the foreign minister and our ambassador in  ienna knew him and  alued him.

He was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they ha e certain negati e qualities, a oid doing certain things, and speak French. He was one of those, who, liking work, knew how to do it, and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table.

He worked well whate er the import of his work.

It was not the question "What for?" but the question "How?" that interested him.

What the diplomatic matter might be he did not care, but it ga e him great pleasure to prepare a circular, memorandum, or report, skillfully, pointedly, and elegantly.

Bilibin's ser ices were  alued not only for what he wrote, but also for his skill in dealing and con ersing with those in the highest spheres.

Bilibin liked con ersation as he liked work, only when it could be made elegantly witty.

In society he always awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a con ersation only when that was possible.

His con ersation was always sprinkled with wittily original, finished phrases of general interest.

These sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally, so that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to drawing room.

And, in fact, Bilibin's witticisms were hawked about in the  iennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters considered important.

His thin, worn, sallow face was co ered with deep wrinkles, which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one's fingers after a Russian bath.

The mo ement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of expression on his face.

Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted, then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks.

His small, deep set eyes always twinkled and looked out straight.

"Well, now tell me about your exploits," said he.

Bolkonski,  ery modestly without once mentioning himself, described the engagement and his reception by the Minister of War.

"They recei ed me and my news as one recei es a dog in a game of skittles," said he in conclusion.

Bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared.

"Cependant, mon cher," he remarked, examining his nails from a distance and puckering the skin abo e his left eye, "malgre la haute estime que je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army, j'a oue que  otre  ictoire n'est pas des plus  ictorieuses."     "But my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodox Russian army, I must say that your  ictory was not particularly  ictorious."

He went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those words in Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.

"Come now!

You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier and his one di ision, and e en then Mortier slips through your fingers!

Where's the  ictory?"

"But seriously," said Prince Andrew, "we can at any rate say without boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm..."

"Why didn't you capture one, just one, marshal for us?"

"Because not e erything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of a parade.

We had expected, as I told you, to get at their rear by se en in the morning but had not reached it by fi e in the afternoon."

"And why didn't you do it at se en in the morning?

You ought to ha e been there at se en in the morning," returned Bilibin with a smile. "You ought to ha e been there at se en in the morning."

"Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic methods that he had better lea e Genoa alone?" retorted Prince Andrew in the same tone.

"I know," interrupted Bilibin, "you're thinking it's  ery easy to take marshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire!

That is true, but still why didn't you capture him?

So don't be surprised if not only the Minister of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and King Francis is not much delighted by your  ictory. E en I, a poor secretary of the Russian Embassy, do not feel any need in token of my joy to gi e my Franz a thaler, or let him go with his Liebchen to the Prater... True, we ha e no Prater here..."

He looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his forehead.

"It is now my turn to ask you 'why?' mon cher," said Bolkonski. "I confess I do not understand  perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence, but I can't make it out. Mack loses a whole army, the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke Karl gi e no signs of life and make blunder after blunder. Kutuzo  alone at last gains a real  ictory, destroying the spell of the in incibility of the French, and the Minister of War does not e en care to hear the details."

"That's just it, my dear fellow.

You see it's hurrah for the Tsar, for Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith!

All that is beautiful, but what do we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your  ictories?

Bring us nice news of a  ictory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one archduke's as good as another, as you know) and e en if it is only o er a fire brigade of Bonaparte's, that will be another story and we'll fire off some cannon!

But this sort of thing seems done on purpose to  ex us.

The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself.

You abandon  ienna, gi e up its defense     as much as to say  'Hea en is with us, but hea en help you and your capital!'

The one general whom we all lo ed, Schmidt, you expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the  ictory! Admit that more irritating news than yours could not ha e been concei ed.

It's as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose. Besides, suppose you did gain a brilliant  ictory, if e en the Archduke Karl gained a  ictory, what effect would that ha e on the general course of e ents?

It's too late now when  ienna is occupied by the French army!"

"What? Occupied?

 ienna occupied?"

"Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is at Schonbrunn, and the count, our dear Count  rbna, goes to him for orders."

After the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception, and especially after ha ing dined, Bolkonski felt that he could not take in the full significance of the words he heard.

"Count Lichtenfels was here this morning," Bilibin continued, "and showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in  ienna was fully described  Prince Murat et tout le tremblement... You see that your  ictory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can't be recei ed as a sa ior."

"Really I don't care about that, I don't care at all," said Prince Andrew, beginning to understand that his news of the battle before Krems was really of small importance in  iew of such e ents as the fall of Austria's capital. "How is it  ienna was taken?

What of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg?

We heard reports that Prince Auersperg was defending  ienna?" he said.

"Prince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the ri er, and is defending us     doing it  ery badly, I think, but still he is defending us.

But  ienna is on the other side.

No, the bridge has not yet been taken and I hope it will not be, for it is mined and orders ha e been gi en to blow it up.

Otherwise we should long ago ha e been in the mountains of Bohemia, and you and your army would ha e spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires."

"But still this does not mean that the campaign is o er," said Prince Andrew.

"Well, I think it is.

The bigwigs here think so too, but they daren't say so.

It will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign, it won't be your skirmishing at Durrenstein, or gunpowder at all, that will decide the matter, but those who de ised it," said Bilibin quoting one of his own mots, releasing the wrinkles on his forehead, and pausing. "The only question is what will come of the meeting between the Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia in Berlin?

If Prussia joins the Allies, Austria's hand will be forced and there will be war.

If not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the new Campo Formio are to be drawn up."

"What an extraordinary genius!" Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed, clenching his small hand and striking the table with it, "and what luck the man has!"

"Buonaparte?" said Bilibin inquiringly, puckering up his forehead to indicate that he was about to say something witty. "Buonaparte?" he repeated, accentuating the u  "I think, howe er, now that he lays down laws for Austria at Schonbrunn, il faut lui faire grace de l'u!   I shall certainly adopt an inno ation and call him simply Bonaparte!"   "We must let him off the u!"

"But joking apart," said Prince Andrew, "do you really think the campaign is o er?"

"This is what I think.

Austria has been made a fool of, and she is not used to it.

She will retaliate.

And she has been fooled in the first place because her pro inces ha e been pillaged     they say the Holy Russian army loots terribly     her army is destroyed, her capital taken, and all this for the beaux yeux   of His Sardinian Majesty.

And therefore     this is between oursel es     I instincti ely feel that we are being decei ed, my instinct tells me of negotiations with France and projects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately."

  Fine eyes. "Impossible!" cried Prince Andrew. "That would be too base."

"If we li e we shall see," replied Bilibin, his face again becoming smooth as a sign that the con ersation was at an end.

When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows, he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far, far away from him.

The alliance with Prussia, Austria's treachery, Bonaparte's new triumph, tomorrow's le ee and parade, and the audience with the Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts.

He closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, of musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears, and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill, the French were firing, and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode forward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around, and he experienced tenfold the joy of li ing, as he had not done since childhood.

He woke up...

"Yes, that all happened!" he said, and, smiling happily to himself like a child, he fell into a deep, youthful slumber.

CHAPTER XI

Next day he woke late.

Recalling his recent impressions, the first thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the Emperor Francis  he remembered the Minister of War, the polite Austrian adjutant, Bilibin, and last night's con ersation.

Ha ing dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform, which he had not worn for a long time, he went into Bilibin's study fresh, animated, and handsome, with his hand bandaged.

In the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps.

With Prince Hippolyte Kuragin, who was a secretary to the embassy, Bolkonski was already acquainted. Bilibin introduced him to the others.

The gentlemen assembled at Bilibin's were young, wealthy, gay society men, who here, as in  ienna, formed a special set which Bilibin, their leader, called les notres.   This set, consisting almost exclusi ely of diplomats, e idently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war or politics but related to high society, to certain women, and to the official side of the ser ice.

These gentlemen recei ed Prince Andrew as one of themsel es, an honor they did not extend to many.

From politeness and to start con ersation, they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle, and then the talk went off into merry jests and gossip.

  Ours. "But the best of it was," said one, telling of the misfortune of a fellow diplomat, "that the Chancellor told him flatly that his appointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it.

Can you fancy the figure he cut?..."

"But the worst of it, gentlemen     I am gi ing Kuragin away to you     is that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is taking ad antage of it!"

Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs o er its arm.

He began to laugh.

"Tell me about that!" he said.

"Oh, you Don Juan!

You serpent!" cried se eral  oices.

"You, Bolkonski, don't know," said Bilibin turning to Prince Andrew, "that all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of the Russian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the women!"

"La femme est la compagne de l'homme,"   announced Prince Hippolyte, and began looking through a lorgnette at his ele ated legs.

  "Woman is man's companion." Bilibin and the rest of "ours" burst out laughing in Hippolyte's face, and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whom     he had to admit     he had almost been jealous on his wife's account, was the butt of this set.

"Oh, I must gi e you a treat," Bilibin whispered to Bolkonski. "Kuragin is exquisite when he discusses politics     you should see his gra ity!"

He sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to him about politics.

Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these two.

"The Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance," began Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, "without expressing... as in its last note... you understand... Besides, unless His Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance...

"Wait, I ha e not finished..." he said to Prince Andrew, seizing him by the arm,

"I belie e that inter ention will be stronger than noninter ention.

And..." he paused.

"Finally one cannot impute the nonreceipt of our dispatch of No ember 18.

That is how it will end."

And he released Bolkonski's arm to indicate that he had now quite finished.

"Demosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden mouth!" said Bilibin, and the mop of hair on his head mo ed with satisfaction.

E erybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone.

He was e idently distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild laughter that con ulsed his usually impassi e features.

"Well now, gentlemen," said Bilibin, "Bolkonski is my guest in this house and in Brunn itself. I want to entertain him as far as I can, with all the pleasures of life here.

If we were in  ienna it would be easy, but here, in this wretched Mora ian hole, it is more difficult, and I beg you all to help me.

Brunn's attractions must be shown him. You can undertake the theater, I society, and you, Hippolyte, of course the women."

"We must let him see Amelie, she's exquisite!" said one of "ours," kissing his finger tips.

"In general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane interests," said Bilibin.

"I shall scarcely be able to a ail myself of your hospitality, gentlemen, it is already time for me to go," replied Prince Andrew looking at his watch.

"Where to?"

"To the Emperor."

"Oh! Oh! Oh!

Well, au re oir, Bolkonski!

Au re oir, Prince! Come back early to dinner," cried se eral  oices. "We'll take you in hand."

"When speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the way that pro isions are supplied and the routes indicated," said Bilibin, accompanying him to the hall.

"I should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts, I can't," replied Bolkonski, smiling.

"Well, talk as much as you can, anyway.

He has a passion for gi ing audiences, but he does not like talking himself and can't do it, as you will see."

CHAPTER XII

At the le ee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had been told to, and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his face and just nodded to him with his long head.

But after it was o er, the adjutant he had seen the pre ious day ceremoniously informed Bolkonski that the Emperor desired to gi e him an audience.

The Emperor Francis recei ed him standing in the middle of the room.

Before the con ersation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say.

"Tell me, when did the battle begin?" he asked hurriedly.

Prince Andrew replied.

Then followed other questions just as simple  "Was Kutuzo  well? When had he left Krems?" and so on.

The Emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a gi en number of questions     the answers to these questions, as was only too e ident, did not interest him.

"At what o'clock did the battle begin?" asked the Emperor.

"I cannot inform Your Majesty at what o'clock the battle began at the front, but at Durrenstein, where I was, our attack began after fi e in the afternoon," replied Bolkonski growing more animated and expecting that he would ha e a chance to gi e a reliable account, which he had ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen.

But the Emperor smiled and interrupted him.

"How many miles?"

"From where to where, Your Majesty?"

"From Durrenstein to Krems."

"Three and a half miles, Your Majesty."

"The French ha e abandoned the left bank?"

"According to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the night."

"Is there sufficient forage in Krems?"

"Forage has not been supplied to the extent..."

The Emperor interrupted him.

"At what o'clock was General Schmidt killed?"

"At se en o'clock, I belie e."

"At se en o'clock?

It's  ery sad,  ery sad!"

The Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed.

Prince Andrew withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides.

E erywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words.

Yesterday's adjutant reproached him for not ha ing stayed at the palace, and offered him his own house.

The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the Maria Theresa Order of the third grade, which the Emperor was conferring on him.

The Empress' chamberlain in ited him to see Her Majesty.

The archduchess also wished to see him.

He did not know whom to answer, and for a few seconds collected his thoughts.

Then the Russian ambassador took him by the shoulder, led him to the window, and began to talk to him.

Contrary to Bilibin's forecast the news he had brought was joyfully recei ed.

A thanksgi ing ser ice was arranged, Kutuzo  was awarded the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army recei ed rewards.

Bolkonski was in ited e erywhere, and had to spend the whole morning calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries.

Between four and fi e in the afternoon, ha ing made all his calls, he was returning to Bilibin's house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his  isit to Brunn.

At the door he found a  ehicle half full of luggage. Franz, Bilibin's man, was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door.

Before returning to Bilibin's Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop to pro ide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent some time in the shop.

"What is it?" he asked.

"Oh, your excellency!" said Franz, with difficulty rolling the portmanteau into the  ehicle, "we are to mo e on still farther.

The scoundrel is again at our heels!"

"Eh? What?" asked Prince Andrew.

Bilibin came out to meet him.

His usually calm face showed excitement.

"There now!

Confess that this is delightful," said he. "This affair of the Thabor Bridge, at  ienna....

They ha e crossed without striking a blow!"

Prince Andrew could not understand.

"But where do you come from not to know what e ery coachman in the town knows?"

"I come from the archduchess'.

I heard nothing there."

"And you didn't see that e erybody is packing up?"

"I did not... What is it all about?" inquired Prince Andrew impatiently.

"What's it all about?

Why, the French ha e crossed the bridge that Auersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up  so Murat is now rushing along the road to Brunn and will be here in a day or two."

"What? Here?

But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was mined?"

"That is what I ask you.

No one, not e en Bonaparte, knows why."

Bolkonski shrugged his shoulders.

"But if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It will be cut off," said he.

"That's just it," answered Bilibin. "Listen!

The French entered  ienna as I told you.

 ery well.

Next day, which was yesterday, those gentlemen, messieurs les marechaux,   Murat, Lannes, and Belliard, mount and ride to the bridge. (Obser e that all three are Gascons.) 'Gentlemen,' says one of them, 'you know the Thabor Bridge is mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross?

But it will please our so ereign the Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us three go and take it!' 'Yes, let's!' say the others. And off they go and take the bridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on this side of the Danube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication."   The marshalls.

"Stop jesting," said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously.

This news grie ed him and yet he was pleased.

As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of this position  that here was the Toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame!

Listening to Bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would gi e an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could sa e the army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan.

"Stop this jesting," he said

"I am not jesting," Bilibin went on. "Nothing is truer or sadder.

These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wa e white handkerchiefs  they assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on their way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg.

He lets them enter the tete de pont.   They spin him a thousand gasconades, saying that the war is o er, that the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with Bonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auersperg, and so on.

The officer sends for Auersperg  these gentlemen embrace the officers, crack jokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobser ed, flings the bags of incendiary material into the water, and approaches the tete de pont.

At length appears the lieutenant general, our dear Prince Auersperg  on Mautern himself.

'Dearest foe!

Flower of the Austrian army, hero of the Turkish wars Hostilities are ended, we can shake one another's hand.... The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auersperg's acquaintance.'

In a word, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so bewildered him with fine words, and he is so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals, and so dazzled by the sight of Murat's mantle and ostrich plumes, qu'il n'y  oit que du feu, et oublie celui qu'il de ait faire faire sur l'ennemi!"  (2) In spite of the animation of his speech, Bilibin did not forget to pause after this mot to gi e time for its due appreciation. "The French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes the guns, and the bridge is taken!

But what is best of all," he went on, his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, "is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to gi e the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French troops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes stayed his hand.

The sergeant, who was e idently wiser than his general, goes up to Auersperg and says 

'Prince, you are being decei ed, here are the French!'

Murat, seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak, turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a true Gascon) and says 

'I don't recognize the world famous Austrian discipline, if you allow a subordinate to address you like that!'

It was a stroke of genius.

Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and orders the sergeant to be arrested.

Come, you must own that this affair of the Thabor Bridge is delightful!

It is not exactly stupidity, nor rascality...."   Bridgehead.   (2) That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought to be firing at the enemy.

"It may be treachery," said Prince Andrew,  i idly imagining the gray o ercoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing, and the glory that awaited him.

"Not that either.

That puts the court in too bad a light," replied Bilibin. "It's not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity  it is just as at Ulm... it is..."     he seemed to be trying to find the right expression. "C'est... c'est du Mack.

Nous sommes mackes (It is... it is a bit of Mack.

We are Macked)," he concluded, feeling that he had produced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated.

His hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a slight smile he began to examine his nails.

"Where are you off to?" he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had risen and was going toward his room.

"I am going away."

"Where to?"

"To the army."

"But you meant to stay another two days?"

"But now I am off at once."

And Prince Andrew after gi ing directions about his departure went to his room.

"Do you know, mon cher," said Bilibin following him, "I ha e been thinking about you.

Why are you going?"

And in proof of the conclusi eness of his opinion all the wrinkles  anished from his face.

Prince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and ga e no reply.

"Why are you going?

I know you think it your duty to gallop back to the army now that it is in danger.

I understand that. Mon cher, it is heroism!"

"Not at all," said Prince Andrew.

"But as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the other side of the question and you will see that your duty, on the contrary, is to take care of yourself.

Lea e it to those who are no longer fit for anything else.... You ha e not been ordered to return and ha e not been dismissed from here  therefore, you can stay and go with us where er our ill luck takes us.

They say we are going to Olmutz, and Olmutz is a  ery decent town.

You and I will tra el comfortably in my caleche."

"Do stop joking, Bilibin," cried Bolkonski.

"I am speaking sincerely as a friend!

Consider!

Where and why are you going, when you might remain here?

You are faced by one of two things," and the skin o er his left temple puckered, "either you will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will share defeat and disgrace with Kutuzo 's whole army."

And Bilibin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was insoluble.

"I cannot argue about it," replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he thought  "I am going to sa e the army."

"My dear fellow, you are a hero!" said Bilibin.

CHAPTER XIII

That same night, ha ing taken lea e of the Minister of War, Bolkonski set off to rejoin the army, not knowing where he would find it and fearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems.

In Brunn e erybody attached to the court was packing up, and the hea y baggage was already being dispatched to Olmutz.

Near Hetzelsdorf Prince Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was mo ing with great haste and in the greatest disorder.

The road was so obstructed with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage.

Prince Andrew took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, and hungry and weary, making his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the commander in chief and of his own luggage.

 ery sinister reports of the position of the army reached him as he went along, and the appearance of the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors.

"Cette armee russe que l'or de l'Angleterre a transportee des extremites de l'uni ers, nous allons lui faire eprou er le meme sort     (le sort de l'armee d'Ulm)."   He remembered these words in Bonaparte's address to his army at the beginning of the campaign, and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero, a feeling of wounded pride, and a hope of glory. "And should there be nothing left but to die?" he thought. "Well, if need be, I shall do it no worse than others."   "That Russian army which has been brought from the ends of the earth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same fate     (the fate of the army at Ulm)."

He looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments, carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and  ehicles of all kinds o ertaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and sometimes four abreast.

From all sides, behind and before, as far as ear could reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts and gun carriages, the tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the urging of horses, and the swearing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers.

All along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen, some flayed, some not, and broken down carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something, and again soldiers straggling from their companies, crowds of whom set off to the neighboring  illages, or returned from them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks.

At each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of shouting more incessant.

Soldiers floundering knee deep in mud pushed the guns and wagons themsel es. Whips cracked, hoofs slipped, traces broke, and lungs were strained with shouting.

The officers directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts.

Their  oices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder.

"Here is our dear Orthodox Russian army," thought Bolkonski, recalling Bilibin's words.

Wishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to a con oy.

Directly opposite to him came a strange one horse  ehicle, e idently rigged up by soldiers out of any a ailable materials and looking like something between a cart, a cabriolet, and a caleche.

A soldier was dri ing, and a woman en eloped in shawls sat behind the apron under the leather hood of the  ehicle.

Prince Andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was di erted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the  ehicle.

An officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was dri ing the woman's  ehicle for trying to get ahead of others, and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage.

The woman screamed piercingly.

Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apron and, wa ing her thin arms from under the woolen shawl, cried 

"Mr. Aide de camp!

Mr. Aide de camp!... For hea en's sake... Protect me! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Se enth Chasseurs.... They won't let us pass, we are left behind and ha e lost our people..."

"I'll flatten you into a pancake!" shouted the angry officer to the soldier. "Turn back with your slut!"

"Mr. Aide de camp! Help me!...

What does it all mean?" screamed the doctor's wife.

"Kindly let this cart pass.

Don't you see it's a woman?" said Prince Andrew riding up to the officer.

The officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the soldier. "I'll teach you to push on!... Back!"

"Let them pass, I tell you!" repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his lips.

"And who are you?" cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy rage, "who are you?

Are you in command here? Eh?

I am commander here, not you!

Go back or I'll flatten you into a pancake," repeated he.

This expression e idently pleased him.

"That was a nice snub for the little aide de camp," came a  oice from behind.

Prince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless, tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying.

He saw that his championship of the doctor's wife in her queer trap might expose him to what he dreaded more than anything in the world     to ridicule  but his instinct urged him on.

Before the officer finished his sentence Prince Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised his riding whip.

"Kind...ly let     them     pass!"

The officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.

"It's all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there's this disorder," he muttered. "Do as you like."

Prince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the doctor's wife, who was calling him her deli erer, and recalling with a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to the  illage where he was told that the commander in chief was.

On reaching the  illage he dismounted and went to the nearest house, intending to rest if but for a moment, eat something, and try to sort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind.

"This is a mob of scoundrels and not an army," he was thinking as he went up to the window of the first house, when a familiar  oice called him by name.

He turned round.

Nes itski's handsome face looked out of the little window.

Nes itski, mo ing his moist lips as he chewed something, and flourishing his arm, called him to enter.

"Bolkonski! Bolkonski!...

Don't you hear? Eh?

Come quick..." he shouted.

Entering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nes itski and another adjutant ha ing something to eat.

They hastily turned round to him asking if he had any news.

On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm.

This was particularly noticeable on Nes itski's usually laughing countenance.

"Where is the commander in chief?" asked Bolkonski.

"Here, in that house," answered the adjutant.

"Well, is it true that it's peace and capitulation?" asked Nes itski.

"I was going to ask you.

I know nothing except that it was all I could do to get here."

"And we, my dear boy!

It's terrible!

I was wrong to laugh at Mack, we're getting it still worse," said Nes itski. "But sit down and ha e something to eat."

"You won't be able to find either your baggage or anything else now, Prince. And God only knows where your man Peter is," said the other adjutant.

"Where are headquarters?"

"We are to spend the night in Znaim."

"Well, I ha e got all I need into packs for two horses," said Nes itski. "They' e made up splendid packs for me     fit to cross the Bohemian mountains with.

It's a bad lookout, old fellow!

But what's the matter with you? You must be ill to shi er like that," he added, noticing that Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock.

"It's nothing," replied Prince Andrew.

He had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor's wife and the con oy officer.

"What is the commander in chief doing here?" he asked.

"I can't make out at all," said Nes itski.

"Well, all I can make out is that e erything is abominable, abominable, quite abominable!" said Prince Andrew, and he went off to the house where the commander in chief was.

Passing by Kutuzo 's carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his suite, with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together, Prince Andrew entered the passage.

Kutuzo  himself, he was told, was in the house with Prince Bagration and Weyrother.

Weyrother was the Austrian general who had succeeded Schmidt.

In the passage little Kozlo ski was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk.

The clerk, with cuffs turned up, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards.

Kozlo ski's face looked worn     he too had e idently not slept all night.

He glanced at Prince Andrew and did not e en nod to him.

"Second line... ha e you written it?" he continued dictating to the clerk. "The Kie  Grenadiers, Podolian..."

"One can't write so fast, your honor," said the clerk, glancing angrily and disrespectfully at Kozlo ski.

Through the door came the sounds of Kutuzo 's  oice, excited and dissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar  oice.

From the sound of these  oices, the inattenti e way Kozlo ski looked at him, the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk and Kozlo ski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander in chief, and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the horses near the window, Prince Andrew felt that something important and disastrous was about to happen.

He turned to Kozlo ski with urgent questions.

"Immediately, Prince," said Kozlo ski. "Dispositions for Bagration."

"What about capitulation?"

"Nothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a battle."

Prince Andrew mo ed toward the door from whence  oices were heard.

Just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the door opened, and Kutuzo  with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway.

Prince Andrew stood right in front of Kutuzo  but the expression of the commander in chief's one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to be obli ious of his presence.

He looked straight at his adjutant's face without recognizing him.

"Well, ha e you finished?" said he to Kozlo ski.

"One moment, your excellency."

Bagration, a gaunt middle aged man of medium height with a firm, impassi e face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief.

"I ha e the honor to present myself," repeated Prince Andrew rather loudly, handing Kutuzo  an en elope.

"Ah, from  ienna?

 ery good.

Later, later!"

Kutuzo  went out into the porch with Bagration.

"Well, good by, Prince," said he to Bagration. "My blessing, and may Christ be with you in your great endea or!"

His face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes.

With his left hand he drew Bagration toward him, and with his right, on which he wore a ring, he made the sign of the cross o er him with a gesture e idently habitual, offering his puffy cheek, but Bagration kissed him on the neck instead.

"Christ be with you!" Kutuzo  repeated and went toward his carriage. "Get in with me," said he to Bolkonski.

"Your excellency, I should like to be of use here.

Allow me to remain with Prince Bagration's detachment."

"Get in," said Kutuzo , and noticing that Bolkonski still delayed, he added  "I need good officers myself, need them myself!"

They got into the carriage and dro e for a few minutes in silence.

"There is still much, much before us," he said, as if with an old man's penetration he understood all that was passing in Bolkonski's mind. "If a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God," he added as if speaking to himself.

Prince Andrew glanced at Kutuzo 's face only a foot distant from him and in oluntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the empty eye socket.

"Yes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those men's death," thought Bolkonski.

"That is why I beg to be sent to that detachment," he said.

Kutuzo  did not reply.

He seemed to ha e forgotten what he had been saying, and sat plunged in thought.

Fi e minutes later, gently swaying on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew.

There was not a trace of agitation on his face.

With delicate irony he questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his inter iew with the Emperor, about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems affair, and about some ladies they both knew.

CHAPTER XI 

On No ember 1 Kutuzo  had recei ed, through a spy, news that the army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position.

The spy reported that the French, after crossing the bridge at  ienna, were ad ancing in immense force upon Kutuzo 's line of communication with the troops that were arri ing from Russia.

If Kutuzo  decided to remain at Krems, Napoleon's army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand, and he would find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm.

If Kutuzo  decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arri ing from Russia, he would ha e to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian mountains, defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with Buxhowden.

If Kutuzo  decided to retreat along the road from Krems to Olmutz, to unite with the troops arri ing from Russia, he risked being forestalled on that road by the French who had crossed the  ienna bridge, and encumbered by his baggage and transport, ha ing to accept battle on the march against an enemy three times as strong, who would hem him in from two sides.

Kutuzo  chose this latter course.

The French, the spy reported, ha ing crossed the  ienna bridge, were ad ancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty six miles off on the line of Kutuzo 's retreat.

If he reached Znaim before the French, there would be great hope of sa ing the army  to let the French forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as that of Ulm, or to utter destruction.

But to forestall the French with his whole army was impossible.

The road for the French from  ienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the Russians from Krems to Znaim.

The night he recei ed the news, Kutuzo  sent Bagration's  anguard, four thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems Znaim to the  ienna Znaim road.

Bagration was to make this march without resting, and to halt facing  ienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as possible.

Kutuzo  himself with all his transport took the road to Znaim.

Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his hungry, ill shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way, Bagration came out on the  ienna Znaim road at Hollabrunn a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrunn from  ienna.

Kutuzo  with his transport had still to march for some days before he could reach Znaim. Hence Bagration with his four thousand hungry, exhausted men would ha e to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at Hollabrunn, which was clearly impossible.

But a freak of fate made the impossible possible.

The success of the trick that had placed the  ienna bridge in the hands of the French without a fight led Murat to try to decei e Kutuzo  in a similar way.

Meeting Bagration's weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be Kutuzo 's whole army.

To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arri al of the rest of the troops who were on their way from  ienna, and with this object offered a three days' truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without mo ing.

Murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he therefore offered this truce to a oid unnecessary bloodshed.

Count Nostitz, the Austrian general occupying the ad anced posts, belie ed Murat's emissary and retired, lea ing Bagration's di ision exposed.

Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days' truce.

Bagration replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to Kutuzo  to report the offer he had recei ed.

A truce was Kutuzo 's sole chance of gaining time, gi ing Bagration's exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and hea y con oys (whose mo ements were concealed from the French) ad ance if but one stage nearer Znaim.

The offer of a truce ga e the only, and a quite unexpected, chance of sa ing the army.

On recei ing the news he immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode, who was in attendance on him, to the enemy camp.

Wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation, and meanwhile Kutuzo  sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the mo ements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the Krems Znaim road.

Bagration's exhausted and hungry detachment, which alone co ered this mo ement of the transport and of the whole army, had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself.

Kutuzo 's expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which were in no way binding) might gi e time for part of the transport to pass, and also that Murat's mistake would  ery soon be disco ered, pro ed correct.

As soon as Bonaparte (who was at Schonbrunn, sixteen miles from Hollabrunn) recei ed Murat's dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a capitulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to Murat 

Schonbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,

at eight o'clock in the morning

To PRINCE MURAT, I cannot find words to express to you my displeasure.

You command only my ad ance guard, and ha e no right to arrange an armistice without my order.

You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign.

Break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy.

Inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no one but the Emperor of Russia has that right.

If, howe er, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that con ention, I will ratify it  but it is only a trick.

March on, destroy the Russian army.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.

The Russian Emperor's aide de camp is an impostor. Officers are nothing when they ha e no powers  this one had none.... The Austrians let themsel es be tricked at the crossing of the  ienna bridge, you are letting yourself be tricked by an aide de camp of the Emperor.

NAPOLEON

Bonaparte's adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to Murat.

Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, mo ed with all the Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready  ictim escape, and Bagration's four thousand men merrily lighted campfires, dried and warmed themsel es, cooked their porridge for the first time for three days, and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store for him.

CHAPTER X 

Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon Prince Andrew, who had persisted in his request to Kutuzo , arri ed at Grunth and reported himself to Bagration.

Bonaparte's adjutant had not yet reached Murat's detachment and the battle had not yet begun.

In Bagration's detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs. They talked of peace but did not belie e in its possibility  others talked of a battle but also disbelie ed in the nearness of an engagement.

Bagration, knowing Bolkonski to be a fa orite and trusted adjutant, recei ed him with distinction and special marks of fa or, explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next, and gi ing him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the rearguard and ha e an eye on the order of retreat, "which is also  ery important."

"Howe er, there will hardly be an engagement today," said Bagration as if to reassure Prince Andrew.

"If he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he wishes to stay with me, let him... he'll be of use here if he's a bra e officer," thought Bagration.

Prince Andrew, without replying, asked the prince's permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the forces, so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an order.

The officer on duty, a handsome, elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger, who was fond of speaking French though he spoke it badly, offered to conduct Prince Andrew.

On all sides they saw rain soaked officers with dejected faces who seemed to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors, benches, and fencing from the  illage.

"There now, Prince! We can't stop those fellows," said the staff officer pointing to the soldiers. "The officers don't keep them in hand.

And there," he pointed to a sutler's tent, "they crowd in and sit.

This morning I turned them all out and now look, it's full again.

I must go there, Prince, and scare them a bit.

It won't take a moment."

"Yes, let's go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese," said Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.

"Why didn't you mention it, Prince?

I would ha e offered you something."

They dismounted and entered the tent.

Se eral officers, with flushed and weary faces, were sitting at the table eating and drinking.

"Now what does this mean, gentlemen?" said the staff officer, in the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than once. "You know it won't do to lea e your posts like this.

The prince ga e orders that no one should lea e his post.

Now you, Captain," and he turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who without his boots (he had gi en them to the canteen keeper to dry), in only his stockings, rose when they entered, smiling not altogether comfortably.

"Well, aren't you ashamed of yourself, Captain Tushin?" he continued. "One would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good example, yet here you are without your boots!

The alarm will be sounded and you'll be in a pretty position without your boots!" (The staff officer smiled.) "Kindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of you, all!" he added in a tone of command.

Prince Andrew smiled in oluntarily as he looked at the artillery officer Tushin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged foot to the other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent, kindly eyes from Prince Andrew to the staff officer.

"The soldiers say it feels easier without boots," said Captain Tushin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, e idently wishing to adopt a jocular tone.

But before he had finished he felt that his jest was unacceptable and had not come off.

He grew confused.

"Kindly return to your posts," said the staff officer trying to preser e his gra ity.

Prince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officer's small figure.

There was something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather comic, but extremely attracti e.

The staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on.

Ha ing ridden beyond the  illage, continually meeting and o ertaking soldiers and officers of  arious regiments, they saw on their left some entrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug clay of which showed up red.

Se eral battalions of soldiers, in their shirt slee es despite the cold wind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants  spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the bank by unseen hands.

Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at the entrenchment, and went on again.

Just behind it they came upon some dozens of soldiers, continually replaced by others, who ran from the entrenchment.

They had to hold their noses and put their horses to a trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines.

" oila l'agrement des camps, monsieur le Prince,"   said the staff officer.

  "This is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince."

They rode up the opposite hill.

From there the French could already be seen. Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the position.

"That's our battery," said the staff officer indicating the highest point. "It's in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots. You can see e erything from there  let's go there, Prince."

"Thank you  ery much, I will go on alone," said Prince Andrew, wishing to rid himself of this staff officer's company, "please don't trouble yourself further."

The staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone.

The farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly and cheerful were the troops.

The greatest disorder and depression had been in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road se en miles away from the French.

At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the more confident was the appearance of our troops.

The soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeants major and company officers were counting the men, poking the last man in each section in the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up. Soldiers scattered o er the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building shelters with merry chatter and laughter  around the fires sat others, dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg bands or mending boots or o ercoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers.

In one company dinner was ready, and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler, waiting till the sample, which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log before his shelter, had been tasted.

Another company, a lucky one for not all the companies had  odka, crowded round a pockmarked, broad shouldered sergeant major who, tilting a keg, filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him.

The soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with re erential faces, emptied them, rolling the  odka in their mouths, and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions, licking their lips and wiping them on the slee es of their greatcoats.

All their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment, and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half of them would be left on the field.

After passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kie  grenadiers     fine fellows busy with similar peaceful affairs     near the shelter of the regimental commander, higher than and different from the others, Prince Andrew came out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man.

Two soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and striking him regularly on his bare back.

The man shrieked unnaturally.

A stout major was pacing up and down the line, and regardless of the screams kept repeating 

"It's a shame for a soldier to steal  a soldier must be honest, honorable, and bra e, but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him, he's a scoundrel.

Go on! Go on!"

So the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but unnatural screams, continued.

"Go on, go on!" said the major.

A young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant as he rode by.

Prince Andrew, ha ing reached the front line, rode along it.

Our front line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks, but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that morning, the lines were so near together that the men could see one another's faces and speak to one another.

Besides the soldiers who formed the picket line on either side, there were many curious onlookers who, jesting and laughing, stared at their strange foreign enemies.

Since early morning     despite an injunction not to approach the picket line     the officers had been unable to keep sight seers away.

The soldiers forming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting a curiosity, no longer looked at the French but paid attention to the sight seers and grew weary waiting to be relie ed.

Prince Andrew halted to ha e a look at the French.

"Look! Look there!" one soldier was saying to another, pointing to a Russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and was rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier. "Hark to him jabbering! Fine, isn't it?

It's all the Frenchy can do to keep up with him.

There now, Sidoro !"

"Wait a bit and listen.

It's fine!" answered Sidoro , who was considered an adept at French.

The soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dolokho .

Prince Andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying.

Dolokho  had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed, with his captain.

"Now then, go on, go on!" incited the officer, bending forward and trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to him. "More, please  more!

What's he saying?"

Dolokho  did not answer the captain  he had been drawn into a hot dispute with the French grenadier.

They were naturally talking about the campaign.

The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was trying to pro e that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all the way from Ulm, while Dolokho  maintained that the Russians had not surrendered but had beaten the French.

"We ha e orders to dri e you off here, and we shall dri e you off," said Dolokho .

"Only take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured!" said the French grenadier.

The French onlookers and listeners laughed.

"We'll make you dance as we did under Su oro ...,"   said Dolokho .

  "On  ous fera danser." "Qu' est ce qu'il chante?"   asked a Frenchman.

  "What's he singing about?" "It's ancient history," said another, guessing that it referred to a former war. "The Emperor will teach your Su ara as he has taught the others..."

"Bonaparte..." began Dolokho , but the Frenchman interrupted him.

"Not Bonaparte.

He is the Emperor!

Sacre nom...!" cried he angrily.

"The de il skin your Emperor."

And Dolokho  swore at him in coarse soldier's Russian and shouldering his musket walked away.

"Let us go, I an Lukich," he said to the captain.

"Ah, that's the way to talk French," said the picket soldiers. "Now, Sidoro , you ha e a try!"

Sidoro , turning to the French, winked, and began to jabber meaningless sounds  ery fast 

"Kari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, Kaska," he said, trying to gi e an expressi e intonation to his  oice.

"Ho! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha!

Ouh! ouh!" came peals of such healthy and good humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French in oluntarily, so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to unload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as quickly as possible.

But the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before.

CHAPTER X I

Ha ing ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had told him the whole field could be seen.

Here he dismounted, and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon.

Before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down  he stood at attention when the officer arri ed, but at a sign resumed his measured, monotonous pacing.

Behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes and artillerymen's bonfires.

To the left, not far from the farthest cannon, was a small, newly constructed wattle shed from which came the sound of officers'  oices in eager con ersation.

It was true that a  iew o er nearly the whole Russian position and the greater part of the enemy's opened out from this battery.

Just facing it, on the crest of the opposite hill, the  illage of Schon Grabern could be seen, and in three places to left and right the French troops amid the smoke of their campfires, the greater part of whom were e idently in the  illage itself and behind the hill.

To the left from that  illage, amid the smoke, was something resembling a battery, but it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye.

Our right flank was posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the French position.

Our infantry were stationed there, and at the farthest point the dragoons.

In the center, where Tushin's battery stood and from which Prince Andrew was sur eying the position, was the easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from Schon Grabern.

On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood.

The French line was wider than ours, and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on both sides.

Behind our position was a steep and deep dip, making it difficult for artillery and ca alry to retire.

Prince Andrew took out his notebook and, leaning on the cannon, sketched a plan of the position.

He made some notes on two points, intending to mention them to Bagration.

His idea was, first, to concentrate all the artillery in the center, and secondly, to withdraw the ca alry to the other side of the dip.

Prince Andrew, being always near the commander in chief, closely following the mass mo ements and general orders, and constantly studying historical accounts of battles, in oluntarily pictured to himself the course of e ents in the forthcoming action in broad outline.

He imagined only important possibilities 

"If the enemy attacks the right flank," he said to himself, "the Kie  grenadiers and the Podolsk chasseurs must hold their position till reser es from the center come up.

In that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack.

If they attack our center we, ha ing the center battery on this high ground, shall withdraw the left flank under its co er, and retreat to the dip by echelons." So he reasoned....

All the time he had been beside the gun, he had heard the  oices of the officers distinctly, but as often happens had not understood a word of what they were saying.

Suddenly, howe er, he was struck by a  oice coming from the shed, and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen.

"No, friend," said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, a familiar  oice, "what I say is that if it were possible to know what is beyond death, none of us would be afraid of it.

That's so, friend."

Another, a younger  oice, interrupted him 

"Afraid or not, you can't escape it anyhow."

"All the same, one is afraid!

Oh, you cle er people," said a third manly  oice interrupting them both. "Of course you artillery men are  ery wise, because you can take e erything along with you      odka and snacks."

And the owner of the manly  oice, e idently an infantry officer, laughed.

"Yes, one is afraid," continued the first speaker, he of the familiar  oice. "One is afraid of the unknown, that's what it is.

Whate er we may say about the soul going to the sky... we know there is no sky but only an atmosphere."

The manly  oice again interrupted the artillery officer.

"Well, stand us some of your herb  odka, Tushin," it said.

"Why," thought Prince Andrew, "that's the captain who stood up in the sutler's hut without his boots." He recognized the agreeable, philosophizing  oice with pleasure.

"Some herb  odka? Certainly!" said Tushin. "But still, to concei e a future life..."

He did not finish.

Just then there was a whistle in the air  nearer and nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if it had not finished saying what was necessary, thudded into the ground near the shed with super human force, throwing up a mass of earth.

The ground seemed to groan at the terrible impact.

And immediately Tushin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and his kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed followed by the owner of the manly  oice, a dashing infantry officer who hurried off to his company, buttoning up his coat as he ran.

CHAPTER X II

Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery, looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball.

His eyes ran rapidly o er the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really was a battery to their left.

The smoke abo e it had not yet dispersed.

Two mounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the hill.

A small but distinctly  isible enemy column was mo ing down the hill, probably to strengthen the front line.

The smoke of the first shot had not yet dispersed before another puff appeared, followed by a report.

The battle had begun!

Prince Andrew turned his horse and galloped back to Grunth to find Prince Bagration.

He heard the cannonade behind him growing louder and more frequent.

E idently our guns had begun to reply.

From the bottom of the slope, where the parleys had taken place, came the report of musketry.

Lemarrois had just arri ed at a gallop with Bonaparte's stern letter, and Murat, humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault, had at once mo ed his forces to attack the center and outflank both the Russian wings, hoping before e ening and before the arri al of the Emperor to crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him.

"It has begun.

Here it is!" thought Prince Andrew, feeling the blood rush to his heart.

"But where and how will my Toulon present itself?"

Passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking  odka a quarter of an hour before, he saw e erywhere the same rapid mo ement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready, and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his heart.

"It has begun!

Here it is, dreadful but enjoyable!" was what the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say.

Before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up, he saw, in the light of the dull autumn e ening, mounted men coming toward him.

The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a white horse, was Prince Bagration.

Prince Andrew stopped, waiting for him to come up  Prince Bagration reined in his horse and recognizing Prince Andrew nodded to him.

He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew told him what he had seen.

The feeling, "It has begun! Here it is!" was seen e en on Prince Bagration's hard brown face with its half closed, dull, sleepy eyes.

Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassi e face and wished he could tell what, if anything, this man was thinking and feeling at that moment.

"Is there anything at all behind that impassi e face?" Prince Andrew asked himself as he looked.

Prince Bagration bent his head in sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew told him, and said,

" ery good!" in a tone that seemed to imply that e erything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen.

Prince Andrew, out of breath with his rapid ride, spoke quickly.

Prince Bagration, uttering his words with an Oriental accent, spoke particularly slowly, as if to impress the fact that there was no need to hurry.

Howe er, he put his horse to a trot in the direction of Tushin's battery.

Prince Andrew followed with the suite.

Behind Prince Bagration rode an officer of the suite, the prince's personal adjutant, Zherko , an orderly officer, the staff officer on duty, riding a fine bobtailed horse, and a ci ilian     an accountant who had asked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity.

The accountant, a stout, full faced man, looked around him with a nai e smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, in his camlet coat, as he jolted on his horse with a con oy officer's saddle.

"He wants to see a battle," said Zherko  to Bolkonski, pointing to the accountant, "but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already."

"Oh, lea e off!" said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning smile, as if flattered at being made the subject of Zherko 's joke, and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was.

"It is  ery strange, mon Monsieur Prince," said the staff officer. (He remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing a prince, but could not get it quite right.)

By this time they were all approaching Tushin's battery, and a ball struck the ground in front of them.

"What's that that has fallen?" asked the accountant with a nai e smile.

"A French pancake," answered Zherko .

"So that's what they hit with?" asked the accountant. "How awful!"

He seemed to swell with satisfaction.

He had hardly finished speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly  iolent whistling which suddenly ended with a thud into something soft... f f flop! and a Cossack, riding a little to their right and behind the accountant, crashed to earth with his horse.

Zherko  and the staff officer bent o er their saddles and turned their horses away.

The accountant stopped, facing the Cossack, and examined him with attenti e curiosity.

The Cossack was dead, but the horse still struggled.

Prince Bagration screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing the cause of the confusion, turned away with indifference, as if to say, "Is it worth while noticing trifles?"

He reined in his horse with the case of a skillful rider and, slightly bending o er, disengaged his saber which had caught in his cloak.

It was an old fashioned saber of a kind no longer in general use.

Prince Andrew remembered the story of Su oro  gi ing his saber to Bagration in Italy, and the recollection was particularly pleasant at that moment.

They had reached the battery at which Prince Andrew had been when he examined the battlefield.

"Whose company?" asked Prince Bagration of an artilleryman standing by the ammunition wagon.

He asked, "Whose company?" but he really meant, "Are you frightened here?" and the artilleryman understood him.

"Captain Tushin's, your excellency!" shouted the red haired, freckled gunner in a merry  oice, standing to attention.

"Yes, yes," muttered Bagration as if considering something, and he rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon.

As he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its former position.

A huge, broad shouldered gunner, Number One, holding a mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the wheel  while Number Two with a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannon's mouth.

The short, round shouldered Captain Tushin, stumbling o er the tail of the gun carriage, mo ed forward and, not noticing the general, looked out shading his eyes with his small hand.

"Lift it two lines more and it will be just right," cried he in a feeble  oice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill suited to his weak figure. "Number Two!" he squeaked. "Fire, Med ede !"

Bagration called to him, and Tushin, raising three fingers to his cap with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but like a priest's benediction, approached the general.

Though Tushin's guns had been intended to cannonade the  alley, he was firing incendiary balls at the  illage of Schon Grabern  isible just opposite, in front of which large masses of French were ad ancing.

No one had gi en Tushin orders where and at what to fire, but after consulting his sergeant major, Zakharchenko, for whom he had great respect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the  illage.

" ery good!" said Bagration in reply to the officer's report, and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before him.

The French had ad anced nearest on our right.

Below the height on which the Kie  regiment was stationed, in the hollow where the ri ulet flowed, the soul stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heard, and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons, the officer of the suite pointed out to Bagration a French column that was outflanking us.

To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood.

Prince Bagration ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank.

The officer of the suite  entured to remark to the prince that if these battalions went away, the guns would remain without support.

Prince Bagration turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at him in silence.

It seemed to Prince Andrew that the officer's remark was just and that really no answer could be made to it.

But at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and was retreating upon the Kie  grenadiers.

Prince Bagration bowed his head in sign of assent and appro al.

He rode off at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the French.

But this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground, as a hea y fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly, and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wood.

" ery good!" said Bagration.

As he was lea ing the battery, firing was heard on the left also, and as it was too far to the left flank for him to ha e time to go there himself, Prince Bagration sent Zherko  to tell the general in command (the one who had paraded his regiment before Kutuzo  at Braunau) that he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear, as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy's attack  ery long.

About Tushin and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all was forgotten.

Prince Andrew listened attenti ely to Bagration's colloquies with the commanding officers and the orders he ga e them and, to his surprise, found that no orders were really gi en, but that Prince Bagration tried to make it appear that e erything done by necessity, by accident, or by the will of subordinate commanders was done, if not by his direct command, at least in accord with his intentions.

Prince Andrew noticed, howe er, that though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the commander's will, owing to the tact Bagration showed, his presence was  ery  aluable.

Officers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm  soldiers and officers greeted him gaily, grew more cheerful in his presence, and were e idently anxious to display their courage before him.

CHAPTER X III

Prince Bagration, ha ing reached the highest point of our right flank, began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where on account of the smoke nothing could be seen.

The nearer they got to the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness of the actual battlefield.

They began to meet wounded men.

One with a bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who supported him under the arms.

There was a gurgle in his throat and he was spitting blood.

A bullet had e idently hit him in the throat or mouth.

Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket, groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt, while blood from it was streaming o er his greatcoat as from a bottle.

He had that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering.

Crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw se eral men lying on the ground  they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded.

The soldiers were ascending the hill breathing hea ily, and despite the general's presence were talking loudly and gesticulating.

In front of them rows of gray cloaks were already  isible through the smoke, and an officer catching sight of Bagration rushed shouting after the crowd of retreating soldiers, ordering them back.

Bagration rode up to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there, drowning the sound of  oices and the shouts of command.

The whole air reeked with smoke.

The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it.

Some were using their ramrods, others putting powder on the touchpans or taking charges from their pouches, while others were firing, though who they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no wind to carry away.

A pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were often heard.

"What is this?" thought Prince Andrew approaching the crowd of soldiers. "It can't be an attack, for they are not mo ing  it can't be a square     for they are not drawn up for that."

The commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble looking old man with a pleasant smile     his eyelids drooping more than half o er his old eyes, gi ing him a mild expression, rode up to Bagration and welcomed him as a host welcomes an honored guest.

He reported that his regiment had been attacked by French ca alry and that, though the attack had been repulsed, he had lost more than half his men.

He said the attack had been repulsed, employing this military term to describe what had occurred to his regiment, but in reality he did not himself know what had happened during that half hour to the troops entrusted to him, and could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his regiment had been broken up.

All he knew was that at the commencement of the action balls and shells began flying all o er his regiment and hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted "Ca alry!" and our men had begun firing.

They were still firing, not at the ca alry which had disappeared, but at French infantry who had come into the hollow and were firing at our men.

Prince Bagration bowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected.

Turning to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs whom they had just passed.

Prince Andrew was struck by the changed expression on Prince Bagration's face at this moment.

It expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water.

The dull, sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation of profound thought. The round, steady, hawk's eyes looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on anything although his mo ements were still slow and measured.

The commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagration, entreating him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were.

"Please, your excellency, for God's sake!" he kept saying, glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away from him.

"There, you see!" and he drew attention to the bullets whistling, singing, and hissing continually around them.

He spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax  "We are used to it, but you, sir, will blister your hands."

He spoke as if those bullets could not kill him, and his half closed eyes ga e still more persuasi eness to his words.

The staff officer joined in the colonel's appeals, but Bagration did not reply  he only ga e an order to cease firing and re form, so as to gi e room for the two approaching battalions.

While he was speaking, the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow, dri en by a rising wind, began to mo e from right to left as if drawn by an in isible hand, and the hill opposite, with the French mo ing about on it, opened out before them.

All eyes fastened in oluntarily on this French column ad ancing against them and winding down o er the une en ground.

One could already see the soldiers' shaggy caps, distinguish the officers from the men, and see the standard flapping against its staff.

"They march splendidly," remarked someone in Bagration's suite.

The head of the column had already descended into the hollow.

The clash would take place on this side of it...

The remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up and mo ed to the right  from behind it, dispersing the laggards, came two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order.

Before they had reached Bagration, the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in step could be heard.

On their left flank, nearest to Bagration, marched a company commander, a fine round faced man, with a stupid and happy expression     the same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed.

At that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he would appear as he passed the commander.

With the self satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to his full height without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the hea y tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him.

He carried close to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword (small, cur ed, and not like a real weapon) and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men without losing step, his whole powerful body turning flexibly.

It was as if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander in the best possible manner, and feeling that he was doing it well he was happy.

"Left... left... left..." he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step  and in time to this, with stern but  aried faces, the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in step, and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each alternate step, "Left... left... left..."

A fat major skirted a bush, puffing and falling out of step  a soldier who had fallen behind, his face showing alarm at his defection, ran at a trot, panting to catch up with his company. A cannon ball, clea ing the air, flew o er the heads of Bagration and his suite, and fell into the column to the measure of "Left... left!"

"Close up!" came the company commander's  oice in jaunty tones.

The soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball had fallen, and an old trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men, ran to catch up his line and, falling into step with a hop, looked back angrily, and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison, one seemed to hear left... left... left.

"Well done, lads!" said Prince Bagration.

"Glad to do our best, your ex'len lency!" came a confused shout from the ranks.

A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on Bagration as he shouted, with an expression that seemed to say  "We know that oursel es!" Another, without looking round, as though fearing to relax, shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on.

The order was gi en to halt and down knapsacks.

Bagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted.

He ga e the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed o er his felt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight.

The head of the French column, with its officers leading, appeared from below the hill.

"Forward, with God!" said Bagration, in a resolute, sonorous  oice, turning for a moment to the front line, and slightly swinging his arms, he went forward uneasily o er the rough field with the awkward gait of a ca alryman.

Prince Andrew felt that an in isible power was leading him forward, and experienced great happiness. The French were already near.

Prince Andrew, walking beside Bagration, could clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, and e en their faces. (He distinctly saw an old French officer who, with gaitered legs and turned out toes, climbed the hill with difficulty.) Prince Bagration ga e no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of the ranks.

Suddenly one shot after another rang out from the French, smoke appeared all along their une en ranks, and musket shots sounded.

Se eral of our men fell, among them the round faced officer who had marched so gaily and complacently.

But at the moment the first report was heard, Bagration looked round and shouted,

"Hurrah!" "Hurrah     ah!     ah!" rang a long drawn shout from our ranks, and passing Bagration and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe.

CHAPTER XIX

The attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right flank.

In the center Tushin's forgotten battery, which had managed to set fire to the Schon Grabern  illage, delayed the French ad ance.

The French were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading, and thus ga e us time to retreat.

The retirement of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy, but the different companies did not get mixed.

But our left     which consisted of the Azo  and Podolsk infantry and the Pa lograd hussars     was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under Lannes and was thrown into confusion.

Bagration had sent Zherko  to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately.

Zherko , not remo ing his hand from his cap, turned his horse about and galloped off.

But no sooner had he left Bagration than his courage failed him.

He was seized by panic and could not go where it was dangerous.

Ha ing reached the left flank, instead of going to the front where the firing was, he began to look for the general and his staff where they could not possibly be, and so did not deli er the order.

The command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of the regiment Kutuzo  had re iewed at Braunau and in which Dolokho  was ser ing as a pri ate.

But the command of the extreme left flank had been assigned to the commander of the Pa lograd regiment in which Rosto  was ser ing, and a misunderstanding arose.

The two commanders were much exasperated with one another and, long after the action had begun on the right flank and the French were already ad ancing, were engaged in discussion with the sole object of offending one another.

But the regiments, both ca alry and infantry, were by no means ready for the impending action.

From pri ates to general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations, the ca alry feeding the horses and the infantry collecting wood.

"He higher iss dan I in rank," said the German colonel of the hussars, flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, "so let him do what he  ill, but I cannot sacrifice my hussars...

Bugler, sount ze retreat!"

But haste was becoming imperati e.

Cannon and musketry, mingling together, thundered on the right and in the center, while the capotes of Lannes' sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot.

The general in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps, and ha ing mounted drew himself up  ery straight and tall and rode to the Pa lograd commander.

The commanders met with polite bows but with secret male olence in their hearts.

"Once again, Colonel," said the general, "I can't lea e half my men in the wood.

I beg of you, I beg of you," he repeated, "to occupy the position and prepare for an attack."

"I peg of you yourself not to mix in  ot is not your business!" suddenly replied the irate colonel.

"If you  ere in the ca alry..." "I am not in the ca alry, Colonel, but I am a Russian general and if you are not aware of the fact..."

"Quite a are, your excellency," suddenly shouted the colonel, touching his horse and turning purple in the face. " ill you be so goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot?

I don't  ish to destroy my men for your pleasure!"

"You forget yourself, Colonel.

I am not considering my own pleasure and I won't allow it to be said!"

Taking the colonel's outburst as a challenge to his courage, the general expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the front line, as if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets.

They reached the front, se eral bullets sped o er them, and they halted in silence.

There was nothing fresh to be seen from the line, for from where they had been before it had been e ident that it was impossible for ca alry to act among the bushes and broken ground, as well as that the French were outflanking our left.

The general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing for battle, each  ainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other.

Both passed the examination successfully.

As there was nothing to be said, and neither wished to gi e occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to lea e the range of fire, they would ha e remained there for a long time testing each other's courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood.

The French had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse.

It was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry.

They were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by the French.

Howe er incon enient the position, it was now necessary to attack in order to cut away through for themsel es.

The squadron in which Rosto  was ser ing had scarcely time to mount before it was halted facing the enemy.

Again, as at the Enns bridge, there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy, and again that terrible di iding line of uncertainty and fear     resembling the line separating the li ing from the dead     lay between them.

All were conscious of this unseen line, and the question whether they would cross it or not, and how they would cross it, agitated them all.

The colonel rode to the front, angrily ga e some reply to questions put to him by the officers, and, like a man desperately insisting on ha ing his own way, ga e an order.

No one said anything definite, but the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron.

The command to form up rang out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards.

Still no one mo ed.

The troops of the left flank, infantry and hussars alike, felt that the commander did not himself know what to do, and this irresolution communicated itself to the men.

"If only they would be quick!" thought Rosto , feeling that at last the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so often heard from his fellow hussars.

"Fo'ward, with God, lads!" rang out Deniso 's  oice. "At a twot fo'ward!"

The horses' croups began to sway in the front line.

Rook pulled at the reins and started of his own accord.

Before him, on the right, Rosto  saw the front lines of his hussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but took to be the enemy.

Shots could be heard, but some way off.

"Faster!" came the word of command, and Rosto  felt Rook's flanks drooping as he broke into a gallop.

Rosto  anticipated his horse's mo ements and became more and more elated.

He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him.

This tree had been in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible     and now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible, but e erything was becoming more and more happy and animated.

"Oh, how I will slash at him!" thought Rosto , gripping the hilt of his saber.

"Hur a a a ah!" came a roar of  oices.

"Let anyone come my way now," thought Rosto  dri ing his spurs into Rook and letting him go at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others.

Ahead, the enemy was already  isible.

Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep o er the squadron.

Rosto  raised his saber, ready to strike, but at that instant the trooper Nikitenko, who was galloping ahead, shot away from him, and Rosto  felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot.

From behind him Bondarchuk, an hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked angrily at him.

Bondarchuk's horse swer ed and galloped past.

"How is it I am not mo ing? I ha e fallen, I am killed!" Rosto  asked and answered at the same instant.

He was alone in the middle of a field.

Instead of the mo ing horses and hussars' backs, he saw nothing before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him.

There was warm blood under his arm.

"No, I am wounded and the horse is killed."

Rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back, pinning his rider's leg.

Blood was flowing from his head  he struggled but could not rise.

Rosto  also tried to rise but fell back, his sabretache ha ing become entangled in the saddle.

Where our men were, and where the French, he did not know.

There was no one near.

Ha ing disentangled his leg, he rose.

"Where, on which side, was now the line that had so sharply di ided the two armies?" he asked himself and could not answer.

"Can something bad ha e happened to me?" he wondered as he got up  and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm.

The wrist felt as if it were not his.

He examined his hand carefully,  ainly trying to find blood on it.

"Ah, here are people coming," he thought joyfully, seeing some men running toward him. "They will help me!"

In front came a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned, and with a hooked nose.

Then came two more, and many more running behind.

One of them said something strange, not in Russian.

In among the hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a Russian hussar.

He was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him.

"It must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes.

Can it be that they will take me too?

Who are these men?" thought Rosto , scarcely belie ing his eyes.

"Can they be French?"

He looked at the approaching Frenchmen, and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them to pieces, their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not belie e his eyes.

"Who are they?

Why are they running?

Can they be coming at me?

And why?

To kill me?

Me whom e eryone is so fond of?" He remembered his mother's lo e for him, and his family's, and his friends', and the enemy's intention to kill him seemed impossible.

"But perhaps they may do it!"

For more than ten seconds he stood not mo ing from the spot or realizing the situation.

The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, was already so close that the expression of his face could be seen.

And the excited, alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding his breath, and running so lightly, frightened Rosto .

He seized his pistol and, instead of firing it, flung it at the Frenchman and ran with all his might toward the bushes.

He did not now run with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge, but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds.

One single sentiment, that of fear for his young and happy life, possessed his whole being.

Rapidly leaping the furrows, he fled across the field with the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay, now and then turning his good natured, pale, young face to look back. A shudder of terror went through him 

"No, better not look," he thought, but ha ing reached the bushes he glanced round once more.

The French had fallen behind, and just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk and, turning, shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back.

Rosto  paused.

"No, there's some mistake," thought he. "They can't ha e wanted to kill me."

But at the same time, his left arm felt as hea y as if a se enty pound weight were tied to it.

He could run no more.

The Frenchman also stopped and took aim.

Rosto  closed his eyes and stooped down.

One bullet and then another whistled past him.

He mustered his last remaining strength, took hold of his left hand with his right, and reached the bushes.

Behind these were some Russian sharpshooters.

CHAPTER XX

The infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of the wood ran out of it, the different companies getting mixed, and retreated as a disorderly crowd.

One soldier, in his fear, uttered the senseless cry, "Cut off!" that is so terrible in battle, and that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic.

"Surrounded!

Cut off?

We're lost!" shouted the fugiti es.

The moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind, the general realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment, and the thought that he, an exemplary officer of many years' ser ice who had ne er been to blame, might be held responsible at headquarters for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting the recalcitrant ca alry colonel, his own dignity as a general, and abo e all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for self preser ation, he clutched the crupper of his saddle and, spurring his horse, galloped to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around, but fortunately missed him.

His one desire was to know what was happening and at any cost correct, or remedy, the mistake if he had made one, so that he, an exemplary officer of twenty two years' ser ice, who had ne er been censured, should not be held to blame.

Ha ing galloped safely through the French, he reached a field behind the copse across which our men, regardless of orders, were running and descending the  alley.

That moment of moral hesitation which decides the fate of battles had arri ed. Would this disorderly crowd of soldiers attend to the  oice of their commander, or would they, disregarding him, continue their flight?

Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers, despite his furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to his former self, and the flourishing of his saber, the soldiers all continued to run, talking, firing into the air, and disobeying orders.

The moral hesitation which decided the fate of battles was e idently culminating in a panic.

The general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the powder smoke and stopped in despair.

E erything seemed lost. But at that moment the French who were attacking, suddenly and without any apparent reason, ran back and disappeared from the outskirts, and Russian sharpshooters showed themsel es in the copse.

It was Timokhin's company, which alone had maintained its order in the wood and, ha ing lain in ambush in a ditch, now attacked the French unexpectedly.

Timokhin, armed only with a sword, had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and such mad, drunken determination that, taken by surprise, the French had thrown down their muskets and run.

Dolokho , running beside Timokhin, killed a Frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the surrendering French officer by his collar.

Our fugiti es returned, the battalions re formed, and the French who had nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed.

Our reser e units were able to join up, and the fight was at an end.

The regimental commander and Major Ekonomo  had stopped beside a bridge, letting the retreating companies pass by them, when a soldier came up and took hold of the commander's stirrup, almost leaning against him.

The man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth, he had no knapsack or cap, his head was bandaged, and o er his shoulder a French munition pouch was slung.

He had an officer's sword in his hand.

The soldier was pale, his blue eyes looked impudently into the commander's face, and his lips were smiling. Though the commander was occupied in gi ing instructions to Major Ekonomo , he could not help taking notice of the soldier.

"Your excellency, here are two trophies," said Dolokho , pointing to the French sword and pouch. "I ha e taken an officer prisoner.

I stopped the company." Dolokho  breathed hea ily from weariness and spoke in abrupt sentences. "The whole company can bear witness.

I beg you will remember this, your excellency!"

"All right, all right," replied the commander, and turned to Major Ekonomo .

But Dolokho  did not go away  he untied the handkerchief around his head, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair.

"A bayonet wound. I remained at the front.

Remember, your excellency!"

Tushin's battery had been forgotten and only at the  ery end of the action did Prince Bagration, still hearing the cannonade in the center, send his orderly staff officer, and later Prince Andrew also, to order the battery to retire as quickly as possible.

When the supports attached to Tushin's battery had been mo ed away in the middle of the action by someone's order, the battery had continued firing and was only not captured by the French because the enemy could not surmise that anyone could ha e the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended guns.

On the contrary, the energetic action of that battery led the French to suppose that here     in the center     the main Russian forces were concentrated. Twice they had attempted to attack this point, but on each occasion had been dri en back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns on the hillock.

Soon after Prince Bagration had left him, Tushin had succeeded in setting fire to Schon Grabern.

"Look at them scurrying!

It's burning!

Just see the smoke!

Fine!

Grand!

Look at the smoke, the smoke!" exclaimed the artillerymen, brightening up.

All the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired in the direction of the conflagration.

As if urging each other on, the soldiers cried at each shot 

"Fine!

That's good!

Look at it... Grand!"

The fire, fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading.

The French columns that had ad anced beyond the  illage went back  but as though in re enge for this failure, the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the  illage and began firing them at Tushin's battery.

In their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck in successfully cannonading the French, our artillerymen only noticed this battery when two balls, and then four more, fell among our guns, one knocking o er two horses and another tearing off a munition wagon dri er's leg.

Their spirits once roused were, howe er, not diminished, but only changed character.

The horses were replaced by others from a reser e gun carriage, the wounded were carried away, and the four guns were turned against the ten gun battery.

Tushin's companion officer had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour se enteen of the forty men of the guns' crews had been disabled, but the artillerymen were still as merry and li ely as e er.

Twice they noticed the French appearing below them, and then they fired grapeshot at them.

Little Tushin, mo ing feebly and awkwardly, kept telling his orderly to "refill my pipe for that one!" and then, scattering sparks from it, ran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the French.

"Smack at 'em, lads!" he kept saying, seizing the guns by the wheels and working the screws himself.

Amid the smoke, deafened by the incessant reports which always made him jump, Tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun, now aiming, now counting the charges, now gi ing orders about replacing dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones, and shouting in his feeble  oice, so high pitched and irresolute.

His face grew more and more animated.

Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight, shouting angrily at the men who, as is always the case, hesitated about lifting the injured or dead.

The soldiers, for the most part handsome fellows and, as is always the case in an artillery company, a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their officer     all looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing situation, and the expression on his face was in ariably reflected on theirs.

Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and acti ity, Tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of fear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded ne er occurred to him.

On the contrary, he became more and more elated.

It seemed to him that it was a  ery long time ago, almost a day, since he had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot, and that the corner of the field he stood on was well known and familiar ground.

Though he thought of e erything, considered e erything, and did e erything the best of officers could do in his position, he was in a state akin to fe erish delirium or drunkenness.

From the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle and thud of the enemy's cannon balls, from the flushed and perspiring faces of the crew bustling round the guns, from the sight of the blood of men and horses, from the little puffs of smoke on the enemy's side (always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth, a man, a gun, a horse), from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure.

The enemy's guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes from which occasional puffs were blown by an in isible smoker.

"There... he's puffing again," muttered Tushin to himself, as a small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the wind. "Now look out for the ball... we'll throw it back."

"What do you want, your honor?" asked an artilleryman, standing close by, who heard him muttering.

"Nothing... only a shell..." he answered.

"Come along, our Mat e na!" he said to himself.

"Mat e na"   was the name his fancy ga e to the farthest gun of the battery, which was large and of an old pattern.

The French swarming round their guns seemed to him like ants.

In that world, the handsome drunkard Number One of the second gun's crew was "uncle"  Tushin looked at him more often than at anyone else and took delight in his e ery mo ement.

The sound of musketry at the foot of the hill, now diminishing, now increasing, seemed like someone's breathing.

He listened intently to the ebb and flow of these sounds.   Daughter of Matthew.

"Ah! Breathing again, breathing!" he muttered to himself.

He imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who was throwing cannon balls at the French with both hands.

"Now then, Mat e na, dear old lady, don't let me down!" he was saying as he mo ed from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar  oice called abo e his head 

"Captain Tushin!

Captain!"

Tushin turned round in dismay.

It was the staff officer who had turned him out of the booth at Grunth.

He was shouting in a gasping  oice 

"Are you mad?

You ha e twice been ordered to retreat, and you..."

"Why are they down on me?" thought Tushin, looking in alarm at his superior.

"I... don't..." he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap. "I..."

But the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say.

A cannon ball, flying close to him, caused him to duck and bend o er his horse.

He paused, and just as he was about to say something more, another ball stopped him.

He turned his horse and galloped off.

"Retire!

All to retire!" he shouted from a distance.

The soldiers laughed.

A moment later, an adjutant arri ed with the same order.

It was Prince Andrew.

The first thing he saw on riding up to the space where Tushin's guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a broken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses.

Blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring.

Among the limbers lay se eral dead men.

One ball after another passed o er as he approached and he felt a ner ous shudder run down his spine.

But the mere thought of being afraid roused him again.

"I cannot be afraid," thought he, and dismounted slowly among the guns.

He deli ered the order and did not lea e the battery.

He decided to ha e the guns remo ed from their positions and withdrawn in his presence.

Together with Tushin, stepping across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the French, he attended to the remo al of the guns.

"A staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off," said an artilleryman to Prince Andrew. "Not like your honor!"

Prince Andrew said nothing to Tushin.

They were both so busy as to seem not to notice one another.

When ha ing limbered up the only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the four, they began mo ing down the hill (one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind), Prince Andrew rode up to Tushin.

"Well, till we meet again..." he said, holding out his hand to Tushin.

"Good by, my dear fellow," said Tushin. "Dear soul! Good by, my dear fellow!" and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes.

CHAPTER XXI

The wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder smoke, hung low o er the field of battle on the horizon.

It was growing dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous.

The cannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on the right sounded oftener and nearer.

As soon as Tushin with his guns, continually dri ing round or coming upon wounded men, was out of range of fire and had descended into the dip, he was met by some of the staff, among them the staff officer and Zherko , who had been twice sent to Tushin's battery but had ne er reached it.

Interrupting one another, they all ga e, and transmitted, orders as to how to proceed, reprimanding and reproaching him.

Tushin ga e no orders, and, silently     fearing to speak because at e ery word he felt ready to weep without knowing why     rode behind on his artillery nag.

Though the orders were to abandon the wounded, many of them dragged themsel es after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages.

The jaunty infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of Tushin's wattle shed was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on "Mat e na's" carriage.

At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar cadet, supporting one hand with the other, came up to Tushin and asked for a seat.

"Captain, for God's sake! I' e hurt my arm," he said timidly. "For God's sake... I can't walk.

For God's sake!"

It was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and been refused.

He asked in a hesitating, piteous  oice.

"Tell them to gi e me a seat, for God's sake!"

"Gi e him a seat," said Tushin. "Lay a cloak for him to sit on, lad," he said, addressing his fa orite soldier. "And where is the wounded officer?"

"He has been set down. He died," replied someone. "Help him up.

Sit down, dear fellow, sit down!

Spread out the cloak, Antono ."

The cadet was Rosto .

With one hand he supported the other  he was pale and his jaw trembled, shi ering fe erishly.

He was placed on "Mat e na," the gun from which they had remo ed the dead officer.

The cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm.

"What, are you wounded, my lad?" said Tushin, approaching the gun on which Rosto  sat.

"No, it's a sprain."

"Then what is this blood on the gun carriage?" inquired Tushin.

"It was the officer, your honor, stained it," answered the artilleryman, wiping away the blood with his coat slee e, as if apologizing for the state of his gun.

It was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the infantry, and ha ing reached the  illage of Gruntersdorf they halted.

It had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces off, and the firing had begun to subside.

Suddenly, near by on the right, shouting and firing were again heard.

Flashes of shot gleamed in the darkness.

This was the last French attack and was met by soldiers who had sheltered in the  illage houses.

They all rushed out of the  illage again, but Tushin's guns could not mo e, and the artillerymen, Tushin, and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their fate.

The firing died down and soldiers, talking eagerly, streamed out of a side street.

"Not hurt, Petro ?" asked one.

"We' e gi en it 'em hot, mate!

They won't make another push now," said another.

"You couldn't see a thing.

How they shot at their own fellows!

Nothing could be seen. Pitch dark, brother!

Isn't there something to drink?"

The French had been repulsed for the last time.

And again and again in the complete darkness Tushin's guns mo ed forward, surrounded by the humming infantry as by a frame.

In the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen ri er was flowing always in one direction, humming with whispers and talk and the sound of hoofs and wheels.

Amid the general rumble, the groans and  oices of the wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness of the night.

The gloom that en eloped the army was filled with their groans, which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night.

After a while the mo ing mass became agitated, someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite, and said something in passing 

"What did he say?

Where to, now?

Halt, is it?

Did he thank us?" came eager questions from all sides. The whole mo ing mass began pressing closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt  e idently those in front had halted.

All remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road.

Fires were lighted and the talk became more audible.

Captain Tushin, ha ing gi en orders to his company, sent a soldier to find a dressing station or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the road.

Rosto , too, dragged himself to the fire.

From pain, cold, and damp, a fe erish shi ering shook his whole body.

Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him, but he kept awake by an excruciating pain in his arm, for which he could find no satisfactory position.

He kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire, which seemed to him dazzlingly red, and at the feeble, round shouldered figure of Tushin who was sitting cross legged like a Turk beside him.

Tushin's large, kind, intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and commiseration on Rosto , who saw that Tushin with his whole heart wished to help him but could not.

From all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry, who were walking, dri ing past, and settling down all around.

The sound of  oices, the tramping feet, the horses' hoofs mo ing in mud, the crackling of wood fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble.

It was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen ri er flowing through the gloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm.

Rosto  looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and around him.

An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on his heels, held his hands to the blaze, and turned away his face.

"You don't mind your honor?" he asked Tushin. "I' e lost my company, your honor. I don't know where... such bad luck!"

With the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to the bonfire, and addressing Tushin asked him to ha e the guns mo ed a trifle to let a wagon go past.

After he had gone, two soldiers rushed to the campfire.

They were quarreling and fighting desperately, each trying to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to.

"You picked it up?...

I dare say! You're  ery smart!" one of them shouted hoarsely.

Then a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg band, came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water.

"Must one die like a dog?" said he.

Tushin told them to gi e the man some water.

Then a cheerful soldier ran up, begging a little fire for the infantry.

"A nice little hot torch for the infantry!

Good luck to you, fellow countrymen. Thanks for the fire     we'll return it with interest," said he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick.

Next came four soldiers, carrying something hea y on a cloak, and passed by the fire.

One of them stumbled.

"Who the de il has put the logs on the road?" snarled he.

"He's dead     why carry him?" said another.

"Shut up!"

And they disappeared into the darkness with their load.

"Still aching?" Tushin asked Rosto  in a whisper.

"Yes."

"Your honor, you're wanted by the general.

He is in the hut here," said a gunner, coming up to Tushin.

"Coming, friend."

Tushin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight, walked away from the fire.

Not far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared for him, Prince Bagration sat at dinner, talking with some commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters.

The little old man with the half closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the general who had ser ed blamelessly for twenty two years, flushed by a glass of  odka and the dinner  and the staff officer with the signet ring, and Zherko , uneasily glancing at them all, and Prince Andrew, pale, with compressed lips and fe erishly glittering eyes.

In a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French, and the accountant with the nai e face was feeling its texture, shaking his head in perplexity     perhaps because the banner really interested him, perhaps because it was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look on at a dinner where there was no place for him.

In the next hut there was a French colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons.

Our officers were flocking in to look at him.

Prince Bagration was thanking the indi idual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our losses.

The general whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau was informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn from the wood, mustered the men who were woodcutting, and, allowing the French to pass him, had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and had broken up the French troops.

"When I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was disorganized, I stopped in the road and thought  'I'll let them come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion'     and that's what I did."

The general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened.

Perhaps it might really ha e been so?

Could one possibly make out amid all that confusion what did or did not happen?

"By the way, your excellency, I should inform you," he continued     remembering Dolokho 's con ersation with Kutuzo  and his last inter iew with the gentleman ranker     "that Pri ate Dolokho , who was reduced to the ranks, took a French officer prisoner in my presence and particularly distinguished himself."

"I saw the Pa lograd hussars attack there, your excellency," chimed in Zherko , looking uneasily around. He had not seen the hussars all that day, but had heard about them from an infantry officer. "They broke up two squares, your excellency."

Se eral of those present smiled at Zherko 's words, expecting one of his usual jokes, but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory of our arms and of the day's work, they assumed a serious expression, though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie de oid of any foundation.

Prince Bagration turned to the old colonel 

"Gentlemen, I thank you all  all arms ha e beha ed heroically  infantry, ca alry, and artillery.

How was it that two guns were abandoned in the center?" he inquired, searching with his eyes for someone. (Prince Bagration did not ask about the guns on the left flank  he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the  ery beginning of the action.) "I think I sent you?" he added, turning to the staff officer on duty.

"One was damaged," answered the staff officer, "and the other I can't understand. I was there all the time gi ing orders and had only just left.... It is true that it was hot there," he added, modestly.

Someone mentioned that Captain Tushin was bi ouacking close to the  illage and had already been sent for.

"Oh, but you were there?" said Prince Bagration, addressing Prince Andrew.

"Of course, we only just missed one another," said the staff officer, with a smile to Bolkonski.

"I had not the pleasure of seeing you," said Prince Andrew, coldly and abruptly.

All were silent.

Tushin appeared at the threshold and made his way timidly from behind the backs of the generals.

As he stepped past the generals in the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of his superiors, he did not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled o er it.

Se eral of those present laughed.

"How was it a gun was abandoned?" asked Bagration, frowning, not so much at the captain as at those who were laughing, among whom Zherko  laughed loudest.

Only now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, did his guilt and the disgrace of ha ing lost two guns and yet remaining ali e present themsel es to Tushin in all their horror.

He had been so excited that he had not thought about it until that moment.

The officers' laughter confused him still more.

He stood before Bagration with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter 

"I don't know... your excellency... I had no men... your excellency."

"You might ha e taken some from the co ering troops."

Tushin did not say that there were no co ering troops, though that was perfectly true.

He was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble, and silently fixed his eyes on Bagration as a schoolboy who has blundered looks at an examiner.

The silence lasted some time.

Prince Bagration, apparently not wishing to be se ere, found nothing to say  the others did not  enture to inter ene.

Prince Andrew looked at Tushin from under his brows and his fingers twitched ner ously.

"Your excellency!" Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt  oice, "you were pleased to send me to Captain Tushin's battery.

I went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two guns smashed, and no supports at all."

Prince Bagration and Tushin looked with equal intentness at Bolkonski, who spoke with suppressed agitation.

"And, if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion," he continued, "we owe today's success chiefly to the action of that battery and the heroic endurance of Captain Tushin and his company," and without awaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left the table.

Prince Bagration looked at Tushin, e idently reluctant to show distrust in Bolkonski's emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it, bent his head, and told Tushin that he could go.

Prince Andrew went out with him.

"Thank you  you sa ed me, my dear fellow!" said Tushin.

Prince Andrew ga e him a look, but said nothing and went away.

He felt sad and depressed.

It was all so strange, so unlike what he had hoped.

"Who are they?

Why are they here?

What do they want?

And when will all this end?" thought Rosto , looking at the changing shadows before him.

The pain in his arm became more and more intense.

Irresistible drowsiness o erpowered him, red rings danced before his eyes, and the impression of those  oices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged with the physical pain.

It was they, these soldiers     wounded and unwounded     it was they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder.

To rid himself of them he closed his eyes.

For a moment he dozed, but in that short inter al innumerable things appeared to him in a dream  his mother and her large white hand, Sonya's thin little shoulders, Natasha's eyes and laughter, Deniso  with his  oice and mustache, and Telyanin and all that affair with Telyanin and Bogdanich.

That affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh  oice, and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly, incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one direction.

He tried to get away from them, but they would not for an instant let his shoulder mo e a hair's breadth.

It would not ache     it would be well     if only they did not pull it, but it was impossible to get rid of them.

He opened his eyes and looked up.

The black canopy of night hung less than a yard abo e the glow of the charcoal.

Flakes of falling snow were fluttering in that light.

Tushin had not returned, the doctor had not come.

He was alone now, except for a soldier who was sitting naked at the other side of the fire, warming his thin yellow body.

"Nobody wants me!" thought Rosto . "There is no one to help me or pity me.

Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and lo ed." He sighed and, doing so, groaned in oluntarily.

"Eh, is anything hurting you?" asked the soldier, shaking his shirt out o er the fire, and not waiting for an answer he ga e a grunt and added  "What a lot of men ha e been crippled today     frightful!"

Rosto  did not listen to the soldier.

He looked at the snowflakes fluttering abo e the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm, bright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, his healthy body, and all the affection and care of his family.

"And why did I come here?" he wondered.

Next day the French army did not renew their attack, and the remnant of Bagration's detachment was reunited to Kutuzo 's army.

BOOK THREE  1805

CHAPTER I

Prince  asili was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans.

Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own ad antage.

He was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had become a habit.

Schemes and de ices for which he ne er rightly accounted to himself, but which formed the whole interest of his life, were constantly shaping themsel es in his mind, arising from the circumstances and persons he met.

Of these plans he had not merely one or two in his head but dozens, some only beginning to form themsel es, some approaching achie ement, and some in course of disintegration.

He did not, for instance, say to himself 

"This man now has influence, I must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special grant." Nor did he say to himself 

"Pierre is a rich man, I must entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles I need." But when he came across a man of position his instinct immediately told him that this man could be useful, and without any premeditation Prince  asili took the first opportunity to gain his confidence, flatter him, become intimate with him, and finally make his request.

He had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment as Gentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time conferred the status of Councilor of State, and insisted on the young man accompanying him to Petersburg and staying at his house.

With apparent absent mindedness, yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing, Prince  asili did e erything to get Pierre to marry his daughter.

Had he thought out his plans beforehand he could not ha e been so natural and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with e erybody both abo e and below him in social standing.

Something always drew him toward those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people.

Pierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count Bezukho  and a rich man, felt himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself.

He had to sign papers, to present himself at go ernment offices, the purpose of which was not clear to him, to question his chief steward, to  isit his estate near Moscow, and to recei e many people who formerly did not e en wish to know of his existence but would now ha e been offended and grie ed had he chosen not to see them.

These different people     businessmen, relations, and acquaintances alike     were all disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner  they were all e idently firmly con inced of Pierre's noble qualities.

He was always hearing such words as 

"With your remarkable kindness," or, "With your excellent heart," "You are yourself so honorable Count," or, "Were he as cle er as you," and so on, till he began sincerely to belie e in his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence, the more so as in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he really was  ery kind and intelligent.

E en people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and e idently unfriendly now became gentle and affectionate.

The angry eldest princess, with the long waist and hair plastered down like a doll's, had come into Pierre's room after the funeral.

With drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was  ery sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for anything, except only for permission, after the blow she had recei ed, to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so lo ed and where she had sacrificed so much.

She could not refrain from weeping at these words.

Touched that this statuesque princess could so change, Pierre took her hand and begged her forgi eness, without knowing what for.

From that day the eldest princess quite changed toward Pierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him.

"Do this for my sake, mon cher  after all, she had to put up with a great deal from the deceased," said Prince  asili to him, handing him a deed to sign for the princess' benefit.

Prince  asili had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw this bone     a bill for thirty thousand rubles     to the poor princess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid portfolio.

Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess grew still kinder.

The younger sisters also became affectionate to him, especially the youngest, the pretty one with the mole, who often made him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him.

It seemed so natural to Pierre that e eryone should like him, and it would ha e seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that he could not but belie e in the sincerity of those around him.

Besides, he had no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not.

He was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful intoxication.

He felt as though he were the center of some important and general mo ement  that something was constantly expected of him, that if he did not do it he would grie e and disappoint many people, but if he did this and that, all would be well  and he did what was demanded of him, but still that happy result always remained in the future.

More than anyone else, Prince  asili took possession of Pierre's affairs and of Pierre himself in those early days.

From the death of Count Bezukho  he did not let go his hold of the lad.

He had the air of a man oppressed by business, weary and suffering, who yet would not, for pity's sake, lea e this helpless youth who, after all, was the son of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth, to the caprice of fate and the designs of rogues.

During the few days he spent in Moscow after the death of Count Bezukho , he would call Pierre, or go to him himself, and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness and assurance, as if he were adding e ery time 

"You know I am o erwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that I trouble myself about you, and you also know quite well that what I propose is the only thing possible."

"Well, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last," said Prince  asili one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierre's elbow, speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could not now be altered.

"We start tomorrow and I'm gi ing you a place in my carriage.

I am  ery glad.

All our important business here is now settled, and I ought to ha e been off long ago.

Here is something I ha e recei ed from the chancellor.

I asked him for you, and you ha e been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber.

The diplomatic career now lies open before you."

Notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words were pronounced, Pierre, who had so long been considering his career, wished to make some suggestion.

But Prince  asili interrupted him in the special deep cooing tone, precluding the possibility of interrupting his speech, which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was needed.

"Mais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy my conscience, and there is nothing to thank me for.

No one has e er complained yet of being too much lo ed  and besides, you are free, you could throw it up tomorrow.

But you will see e erything for yourself when you get to Petersburg.

It is high time for you to get away from these terrible recollections." Prince  asili sighed. "Yes, yes, my boy.

And my  alet can go in your carriage.

Ah! I was nearly forgetting," he added. "You know, mon cher, your father and I had some accounts to settle, so I ha e recei ed what was due from the Ryazan estate and will keep it  you won't require it.

We'll go into the accounts later."

By "what was due from the Ryazan estate" Prince  asili meant se eral thousand rubles quitrent recei ed from Pierre's peasants, which the prince had retained for himself.

In Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of gentleness and affection.

He could not refuse the post, or rather the rank (for he did nothing), that Prince  asili had procured for him, and acquaintances, in itations, and social occupations were so numerous that, e en more than in Moscow, he felt a sense of bewilderment, bustle, and continual expectation of some good, always in front of him but ne er attained.

Of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in Petersburg.

The Guards had gone to the front  Dolokho  had been reduced to the ranks  Anatole was in the army somewhere in the pro inces  Prince Andrew was abroad  so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he used to like to spend them, or to open his mind by intimate talks with a friend older than himself and whom he respected.

His whole time was taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at Prince  asili's house in the company of the stout princess, his wife, and his beautiful daughter Helene.

Like the others, Anna Pa lo na Scherer showed Pierre the change of attitude toward him that had taken place in society.

Formerly in Anna Pa lo na's presence, Pierre had always felt that what he was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, that remarks which seemed to him cle er while they formed in his mind became foolish as soon as he uttered them, while on the contrary Hippolyte's stupidest remarks came out cle er and apt.

Now e erything Pierre said was charmant.

E en if Anna Pa lo na did not say so, he could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty.

In the beginning of the winter of 1805 6 Pierre recei ed one of Anna Pa lo na's usual pink notes with an in itation to which was added 

"You will find the beautiful Helene here, whom it is always delightful to see."

When he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and Helene, and that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation were being imposed on him which he could not fulfill, and pleased him as an entertaining supposition.

Anna Pa lo na's "At Home" was like the former one, only the no elty she offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, but a diplomatist fresh from Berlin with the  ery latest details of the Emperor Alexander's  isit to Potsdam, and of how the two august friends had pledged themsel es in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race.

Anna Pa lo na recei ed Pierre with a shade of melancholy, e idently relating to the young man's recent loss by the death of Count Bezukho  (e eryone constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known), and her melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august Majesty the Empress Marya Fedoro na.

Pierre felt flattered by this.

Anna Pa lo na arranged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitual skill.

The large group, in which were Prince  asili and the generals, had the benefit of the diplomat.

Another group was at the tea table.

Pierre wished to join the former, but Anna Pa lo na     who was in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in action     seeing Pierre, touched his slee e with her finger, saying 

"Wait a bit, I ha e something in  iew for you this e ening." (She glanced at Helene and smiled at her.)

"My dear Helene, be charitable to my poor aunt who adores you.

Go and keep her company for ten minutes. And that it will not be too dull, here is the dear count who will not refuse to accompany you."

The beauty went to the aunt, but Anna Pa lo na detained Pierre, looking as if she had to gi e some final necessary instructions.

"Isn't she exquisite?" she said to Pierre, pointing to the stately beauty as she glided away. "And how she carries herself! For so young a girl, such tact, such masterly perfection of manner!

It comes from her heart.

Happy the man who wins her!

With her the least worldly of men would occupy a most brilliant position in society.

Don't you think so?

I only wanted to know your opinion," and Anna Pa lo na let Pierre go.

Pierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to Helene's perfection of manner.

If he e er thought of Helene, it was just of her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society.

The old aunt recei ed the two young people in her corner, but seemed desirous of hiding her adoration for Helene and inclined rather to show her fear of Anna Pa lo na.

She looked at her niece, as if inquiring what she was to do with these people.

On lea ing them, Anna Pa lo na again touched Pierre's slee e, saying 

"I hope you won't say that it is dull in my house again," and she glanced at Helene.

Helene smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted.

The aunt coughed, swallowed, and said in French that she was  ery pleased to see Helene, then she turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome and the same look.

In the middle of a dull and halting con ersation, Helene turned to Pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she ga e to e eryone.

Pierre was so used to that smile, and it had so little meaning for him, that he paid no attention to it.

The aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierre's father, Count Bezukho , and showed them her own box.

Princess Helene asked to see the portrait of the aunt's husband on the box lid.

"That is probably the work of  inesse," said Pierre, mentioning a celebrated miniaturist, and he leaned o er the table to take the snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table.

He half rose, meaning to go round, but the aunt handed him the snuffbox, passing it across Helene's back.

Helene stooped forward to make room, and looked round with a smile.

She was, as always at e ening parties, wearing a dress such as was then fashionable, cut  ery low at front and back.

Her bust, which had always seemed like marble to Pierre, was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but percei e the li ing charm of her neck and shoulders, so near to his lips that he need only ha e bent his head a little to ha e touched them.

He was conscious of the warmth of her body, the scent of perfume, and the creaking of her corset as she mo ed.

He did not see her marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress, but all the charm of her body only co ered by her garments.

And ha ing once seen this he could not help being aware of it, just as we cannot renew an illusion we ha e once seen through.

"So you ha e ne er noticed before how beautiful I am?" Helene seemed to say. "You had not noticed that I am a woman?

Yes, I am a woman who may belong to anyone     to you too," said her glance.

And at that moment Pierre felt that Helene not only could, but must, be his wife, and that it could not be otherwise.

He knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the altar with her.

How and when this would be he did not know, he did not e en know if it would be a good thing (he e en felt, he knew not why, that it would be a bad thing), but he knew it would happen.

Pierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more to see her as a distant beauty far remo ed from him, as he had seen her e ery day until then, but he could no longer do it.

He could not, any more than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has once recognized it to be a tuft of grass.

She was terribly close to him.

She already had power o er him, and between them there was no longer any barrier except the barrier of his own will.

"Well, I will lea e you in your little corner," came Anna Pa lo na's  oice, "I see you are all right there."

And Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything reprehensible, looked round with a blush.

It seemed to him that e eryone knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself.

A little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna Pa lo na said to him 

"I hear you are refitting your Petersburg house?"

This was true. The architect had told him that it was necessary, and Pierre, without knowing why, was ha ing his enormous Petersburg house done up.

"That's a good thing, but don't mo e from Prince  asili's.

It is good to ha e a friend like the prince," she said, smiling at Prince  asili.

"I know something about that.

Don't I? And you are still so young.

You need ad ice.

Don't be angry with me for exercising an old woman's pri ilege." She paused, as women always do, expecting something after they ha e mentioned their age. "If you marry it will be a different thing," she continued, uniting them both in one glance.

Pierre did not look at Helene nor she at him.

But she was just as terribly close to him.

He muttered something and colored.

When he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what had happened.

What had happened?

Nothing.

He had merely understood that the woman he had known as a child, of whom when her beauty was mentioned he had said absent mindedly  "Yes, she's good looking," he had understood that this woman might belong to him.

"But she's stupid. I ha e myself said she is stupid," he thought. "There is something nasty, something wrong, in the feeling she excites in me.

I ha e been told that her brother Anatole was in lo e with her and she with him, that there was quite a scandal and that that's why he was sent away.

Hippolyte is her brother... Prince  asili is her father... It's bad...." he reflected, but while he was thinking this (the reflection was still incomplete), he caught himself smiling and was conscious that another line of thought had sprung up, and while thinking of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife, how she would lo e him become quite different, and how all he had thought and heard of her might be false.

And he again saw her not as the daughter of Prince  asili, but  isualized her whole body only  eiled by its gray dress.

"But no! Why did this thought ne er occur to me before?" and again he told himself that it was impossible, that there would be something unnatural, and as it seemed to him dishonorable, in this marriage.

He recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks of those who had seen them together.

He recalled Anna Pa lo na's words and looks when she spoke to him about his house, recalled thousands of such hints from Prince  asili and others, and was seized by terror lest he had already, in some way, bound himself to do something that was e idently wrong and that he ought not to do.

But at the  ery time he was expressing this con iction to himself, in another part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty.

CHAPTER II

In No ember, 1805, Prince  asili had to go on a tour of inspection in four different pro inces.

He had arranged this for himself so as to  isit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole where his regiment was stationed, and take him to  isit Prince Nicholas Bolkonski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that rich old man.

But before lea ing home and undertaking these new affairs, Prince  asili had to settle matters with Pierre, who, it is true, had latterly spent whole days at home, that is, in Prince  asili's house where he was staying, and had been absurd, excited, and foolish in Helene's presence (as a lo er should be), but had not yet proposed to her.

"This is all  ery fine, but things must be settled," said Prince  asili to himself, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that Pierre who was under such obligations to him ("But ne er mind that") was not beha ing  ery well in this matter.

"Youth, fri olity... well, God be with him," thought he, relishing his own goodness of heart, "but it must be brought to a head.

The day after tomorrow will be Lelya's name day. I will in ite two or three people, and if he does not understand what he ought to do then it will be my affair     yes, my affair.

I am her father."

Six weeks after Anna Pa lo na's "At Home" and after the sleepless night when he had decided that to marry Helene would be a calamity and that he ought to a oid her and go away, Pierre, despite that decision, had not left Prince  asili's and felt with terror that in people's eyes he was e ery day more and more connected with her, that it was impossible for him to return to his former conception of her, that he could not break away from her, and that though it would be a terrible thing he would ha e to unite his fate with hers.

He might perhaps ha e been able to free himself but that Prince  asili (who had rarely before gi en receptions) now hardly let a day go by without ha ing an e ening party at which Pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint e eryone's expectation.

Prince  asili, in the rare moments when he was at home, would take Pierre's hand in passing and draw it downwards, or absent mindedly hold out his wrinkled, clean sha en cheek for Pierre to kiss and would say  "Till tomorrow," or, "Be in to dinner or I shall not see you," or, "I am staying in for your sake," and so on.

And though Prince  asili, when he stayed in (as he said) for Pierre's sake, hardly exchanged a couple of words with him, Pierre felt unable to disappoint him.

E ery day he said to himself one and the same thing 

"It is time I understood her and made up my mind what she really is.

Was I mistaken before, or am I mistaken now?

No, she is not stupid, she is an excellent girl," he sometimes said to himself "she ne er makes a mistake, ne er says anything stupid.

She says little, but what she does say is always clear and simple, so she is not stupid.

She ne er was abashed and is not abashed now, so she cannot be a bad woman!"

He had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in her company, and she had always answered him either by a brief but appropriate remark     showing that it did not interest her     or by a silent look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed Pierre her superiority.

She was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile.

She always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him alone, in which there was something more significant than in the general smile that usually brightened her face.

Pierre knew that e eryone was waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line, and he knew that sooner or later he would step across it, but an incomprehensible terror seized him at the thought of that dreadful step.

A thousand times during that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful abyss, Pierre said to himself 

"What am I doing?

I need resolution.

Can it be that I ha e none?"

He wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that in this matter he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really possessed.

Pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel themsel es quite innocent, and since that day when he was o erpowered by a feeling of desire while stooping o er the snuffbox at Anna Pa lo na's, an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will.

On Helene's name day, a small party of just their own people     as his wife said     met for supper at Prince  asili's.

All these friends and relations had been gi en to understand that the fate of the young girl would be decided that e ening.

The  isitors were seated at supper.

Princess Kuragina, a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome, was sitting at the head of the table.

On either side of her sat the more important guests     an old general and his wife, and Anna Pa lo na Scherer. At the other end sat the younger and less important guests, and there too sat the members of the family, and Pierre and Helene, side by side.

Prince  asili was not ha ing any supper  he went round the table in a merry mood, sitting down now by one, now by another, of the guests.

To each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to Pierre and Helene, whose presence he seemed not to notice.

He enli ened the whole party.

The wax candles burned brightly, the sil er and crystal gleamed, so did the ladies' toilets and the gold and sil er of the men's epaulets  ser ants in scarlet li eries mo ed round the table, the clatter of plates, kni es, and glasses mingled with the animated hum of se eral con ersations.

At one end of the table, the old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he lo ed her passionately, at which she laughed  at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of some Mary  iktoro na or other.

At the center of the table, Prince  asili attracted e erybody's attention.

With a facetious smile on his face, he was telling the ladies about last Wednesday's meeting of the Imperial Council, at which Sergey Kuzmich  yazmitino , the new military go ernor general of Petersburg, had recei ed and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor Alexander from the army to Sergey Kuzmich, in which the Emperor said that he was recei ing from all sides declarations of the people's loyalty, that the declaration from Petersburg ga e him particular pleasure, and that he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endea or to be worthy of it.

This rescript began with the words  "Sergey Kuzmich, From all sides reports reach me," etc.

"Well, and so he ne er got farther than 

'Sergey Kuzmich'?" asked one of the ladies.

"Exactly, not a hair's breadth farther," answered Prince  asili, laughing, "'Sergey Kuzmich... From all sides...

From all sides... Sergey Kuzmich...' Poor  yazmitino  could not get any farther!

He began the rescript again and again, but as soon as he uttered 'Sergey' he sobbed, 'Kuz mi ch,' tears, and 'From all sides' was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther.

And again his handkerchief, and again 

'Sergey Kuzmich, From all sides,'... and tears, till at last somebody else was asked to read it."

"Kuzmich... From all sides... and then tears," someone repeated laughing.

"Don't be unkind," cried Anna Pa lo na from her end of the table holding up a threatening finger. "He is such a worthy and excellent man, our dear  yazmitino ...."

E erybody laughed a great deal.

At the head of the table, where the honored guests sat, e eryone seemed to be in high spirits and under the influence of a  ariety of exciting sensations. Only Pierre and Helene sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a suppressed smile brightening both their faces, a smile that had nothing to do with Sergey Kuzmich     a smile of bashfulness at their own feelings.

But much as all the rest laughed, talked, and joked, much as they enjoyed their Rhine wine, saute, and ices, and howe er they a oided looking at the young couple, and heedless and unobser ant as they seemed of them, one could feel by the occasional glances they ga e that the story about Sergey Kuzmich, the laughter, and the food were all a pretense, and that the whole attention of that company was directed to     Pierre and Helene.

Prince  asili mimicked the sobbing of Sergey Kuzmich and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter, and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said 

"Yes... it's getting on, it will all be settled today."

Anna Pa lo na threatened him on behalf of "our dear  yazmitino ," and in her eyes, which, for an instant, glanced at Pierre, Prince  asili read a congratulation on his future son in law and on his daughter's happiness.

The old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter, and her sigh seemed to say  "Yes, there's nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine, my dear, now that the time has come for these young ones to be thus boldly, pro ocati ely happy."

"And what nonsense all this is that I am saying!" thought a diplomatist, glancing at the happy faces of the lo ers. "That's happiness!"

Into the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting that society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy and handsome young man and woman for one another.

And this human feeling dominated e erything else and soared abo e all their affected chatter.

Jests fell flat, news was not interesting, and the animation was e idently forced.

Not only the guests but e en the footmen waiting at table seemed to feel this, and they forgot their duties as they looked at the beautiful Helene with her radiant face and at the red, broad, and happy though uneasy face of Pierre.

It seemed as if the  ery light of the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone.

Pierre felt that he was the center of it all, and this both pleased and embarrassed him.

He was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation.

He did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly.

Only now and then detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot unexpectedly through his mind.

"So it is all finished!" he thought. "And how has it all happened?

How quickly!

Now I know that not because of her alone, nor of myself alone, but because of e eryone, it must ine itably come about.

They are all expecting it, they are so sure that it will happen that I cannot, I cannot, disappoint them.

But how will it be?

I do not know, but it will certainly happen!" thought Pierre, glancing at those dazzling shoulders close to his eyes.

Or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what.

He felt it awkward to attract e eryone's attention and to be considered a lucky man and, with his plain face, to be looked on as a sort of Paris possessed of a Helen.

"But no doubt it always is and must be so!" he consoled himself. "And besides, what ha e I done to bring it about?

How did it begin?

I tra eled from Moscow with Prince  asili.

Then there was nothing.

So why should I not stay at his house?

Then I played cards with her and picked up her reticule and dro e out with her.

How did it begin, when did it all come about?"

And here he was sitting by her side as her betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her nearness, her breathing, her mo ements, her beauty.

Then it would suddenly seem to him that it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful, and that that was why they all looked so at him, and flattered by this general admiration he would expand his chest, raise his head, and rejoice at his good fortune.

Suddenly he heard a familiar  oice repeating something to him a second time.

But Pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what was said. "I am asking you when you last heard from Bolkonski," repeated Prince  asili a third time. "How absent minded you are, my dear fellow."

Prince  asili smiled, and Pierre noticed that e eryone was smiling at him and Helene.

"Well, what of it, if you all know it?" thought Pierre.

"What of it? It's the truth!" and he himself smiled his gentle childlike smile, and Helene smiled too.

"When did you get the letter?

Was it from Olmutz?" repeated Prince  asili, who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a dispute.

"How can one talk or think of such trifles?" thought Pierre.

"Yes, from Olmutz," he answered, with a sigh.

After supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into the drawing room.

The guests began to disperse, some without taking lea e of Helene.

Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an important occupation, came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away, refusing to let her see them off.

The diplomatist preser ed a mournful silence as he left the drawing room.

He pictured the  anity of his diplomatic career in comparison with Pierre's happiness.

The old general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was.

"Oh, the old fool," he thought. "That Princess Helene will be beautiful still when she's fifty."

"I think I may congratulate you," whispered Anna Pa lo na to the old princess, kissing her soundly. "If I hadn't this headache I'd ha e stayed longer."

The old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her daughter's happiness.

While the guests were taking their lea e Pierre remained for a long time alone with Helene in the little drawing room where they were sitting.

He had often before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her, but had ne er spoken to her of lo e.

Now he felt that it was ine itable, but he could not make up his mind to take the final step.

He felt ashamed  he felt that he was occupying someone else's place here beside Helene.

"This happiness is not for you," some inner  oice whispered to him. "This happiness is for those who ha e not in them what there is in you."

But, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether she was satisfied with the party.

She replied in her usual simple manner that this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had e er had.

Some of the nearest relati es had not yet left.

They were sitting in the large drawing room.

Prince  asili came up to Pierre with languid footsteps.

Pierre rose and said it was getting late.

Prince  asili ga e him a look of stern inquiry, as though what Pierre had just said was so strange that one could not take it in.

But then the expression of se erity changed, and he drew Pierre's hand downwards, made him sit down, and smiled affectionately.

"Well, Lelya?" he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who ha e petted their children from babyhood, but which Prince  asili had only acquired by imitating other parents.

And he again turned to Pierre.

"Sergey Kuzmich     From all sides " he said, unbuttoning the top button of his waistcoat.

Pierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story about Sergey Kuzmich that interested Prince  asili just then, and Prince  asili saw that Pierre knew this.

He suddenly muttered something and went away.

It seemed to Pierre that e en the prince was disconcerted.

The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched Pierre  he looked at Helene and she too seemed disconcerted, and her look seemed to say  "Well, it is your own fault."

"The step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!" thought Pierre, and he again began speaking about indifferent matters, about Sergey Kuzmich, asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly.

Helene answered with a smile that she too had missed it.

When Prince  asili returned to the drawing room, the princess, his wife, was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.

"Of course, it is a  ery brilliant match, but happiness, my dear..." "Marriages are made in hea en," replied the elderly lady.

Prince  asili passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat down on a sofa in a far corner of the room.

He closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing.

His head sank forward and then he roused himself.

"Aline," he said to his wife, "go and see what they are about."

The princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified and indifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room.

Pierre and Helene still sat talking just as before.

"Still the same," she said to her husband.

Prince  asili frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks qui ered and his face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him. Shaking himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps went past the ladies into the little drawing room.

With quick steps he went joyfully up to Pierre.

His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre rose in alarm on seeing it.

"Thank God!" said Prince  asili. "My wife has told me e erything!" (He put one arm around Pierre and the other around his daughter.)     "My dear boy... Lelya...

I am  ery pleased." (His  oice trembled.) "I lo ed your father... and she will make you a good wife... God bless you!..."

He embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his malodorous mouth.

Tears actually moistened his cheeks.

"Princess, come here!" he shouted.

The old princess came in and also wept.

The elderly lady was using her handkerchief too.

Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful Helene's hand se eral times.

After a while they were left alone again.

"All this had to be and could not be otherwise," thought Pierre, "so it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad.

It is good because it's definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt."

Pierre held the hand of his betrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful bosom as it rose and fell.

"Helene!" he said aloud and paused.

"Something special is always said in such cases," he thought, but could not remember what it was that people say.

He looked at her face.

She drew nearer to him.

Her face flushed.

"Oh, take those off... those..." she said, pointing to his spectacles.

Pierre took them off, and his eyes, besides the strange look eyes ha e from which spectacles ha e just been remo ed, had also a frightened and inquiring look.

He was about to stoop o er her hand and kiss it, but with a rapid, almost brutal mo ement of her head, she intercepted his lips and met them with her own.

Her face struck Pierre, by its altered, unpleasantly excited expression.

"It is too late now, it's done  besides I lo e her," thought Pierre.

"Je  ous aime!"   he said, remembering what has to be said at such moments  but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself.   "I lo e you."

Six weeks later he was married, and settled in Count Bezukho 's large, newly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, as people said, of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money.

CHAPTER III

Old Prince Nicholas Bolkonski recei ed a letter from Prince  asili in No ember, 1805, announcing that he and his son would be paying him a  isit. "I am starting on a journey of inspection, and of course I shall think nothing of an extra se enty miles to come and see you at the same time, my honored benefactor," wrote Prince  asili. "My son Anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army, so I hope you will allow him personally to express the deep respect that, emulating his father, he feels for you."

"It seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out, suitors are coming to us of their own accord," incautiously remarked the little princess on hearing the news.

Prince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.

A fortnight after the letter Prince  asili's ser ants came one e ening in ad ance of him, and he and his son arri ed next day.

Old Bolkonski had always had a poor opinion of Prince  asili's character, but more so recently, since in the new reigns of Paul and Alexander Prince  asili had risen to high position and honors.

And now, from the hints contained in his letter and gi en by the little princess, he saw which way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion changed into a feeling of contemptuous ill will.

He snorted whene er he mentioned him.

On the day of Prince  asili's arri al, Prince Bolkonski was particularly discontented and out of temper.

Whether he was in a bad temper because Prince  asili was coming, or whether his being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at Prince  asili's  isit, he was in a bad temper, and in the morning Tikhon had already ad ised the architect not to go to the prince with his report.

"Do you hear how he's walking?" said Tikhon, drawing the architect's attention to the sound of the prince's footsteps. "Stepping flat on his heels     we know what that means...."

Howe er, at nine o'clock the prince, in his  el et coat with a sable collar and cap, went out for his usual walk.

It had snowed the day before and the path to the hothouse, along which the prince was in the habit of walking, had been swept  the marks of the broom were still  isible in the snow and a sho el had been left sticking in one of the soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path.

The prince went through the conser atories, the serfs' quarters, and the outbuildings, frowning and silent.

"Can a sleigh pass?" he asked his o erseer, a  enerable man, resembling his master in manners and looks, who was accompanying him back to the house.

"The snow is deep.

I am ha ing the a enue swept, your honor."

The prince bowed his head and went up to the porch.

"God be thanked," thought the o erseer, "the storm has blown o er!"

"It would ha e been hard to dri e up, your honor," he added. "I heard, your honor, that a minister is coming to  isit your honor."

The prince turned round to the o erseer and fixed his eyes on him, frowning.

"What?

A minister?

What minister?

Who ga e orders?" he said in his shrill, harsh  oice. "The road is not swept for the princess my daughter, but for a minister!

For me, there are no ministers!"

"Your honor, I thought..."

"You thought!" shouted the prince, his words coming more and more rapidly and indistinctly. "You thought!... Rascals! Blackguards!...

I'll teach you to think!" and lifting his stick he swung it and would ha e hit Alpatych, the o erseer, had not the latter instincti ely a oided the blow. "Thought...

Blackguards..." shouted the prince rapidly.

But although Alpatych, frightened at his own temerity in a oiding the stroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly before him, or perhaps for that  ery reason, the prince, though he continued to shout  "Blackguards!... Throw the snow back on the road!" did not lift his stick again but hurried into the house.

Before dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew that the prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him  Mademoiselle Bourienne with a radiant face that said 

"I know nothing, I am the same as usual," and Princess Mary pale, frightened, and with downcast eyes.

What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she ought to beha e like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could not.

She thought  "If I seem not to notice he will think that I do not sympathize with him  if I seem sad and out of spirits myself, he will say (as he has done before) that I'm in the dumps."

The prince looked at his daughter's frightened face and snorted.

"Fool... or dummy!" he muttered.

"And the other one is not here. They' e been telling tales," he thought     referring to the little princess who was not in the dining room.

"Where is the princess?" he asked. "Hiding?"

"She is not  ery well," answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with a bright smile, "so she won't come down.

It is natural in her state."

"Hm! Hm!" muttered the prince, sitting down.

His plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he flung it away.

Tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman.

The little princess was not unwell, but had such an o erpowering fear of the prince that, hearing he was in a bad humor, she had decided not to appear.

"I am afraid for the baby," she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne  "Hea en knows what a fright might do."

In general at Bald Hills the little princess li ed in constant fear, and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling.

The prince reciprocated this antipathy, but it was o erpowered by his contempt for her.

When the little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald Hills, she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne, spent whole days with her, asked her to sleep in her room, and often talked with her about the old prince and criticized him.

"So we are to ha e  isitors, mon prince?" remarked Mademoiselle Bourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers. "His Excellency Prince  asili Kuragin and his son, I understand?" she said inquiringly.

"Hm!     his excellency is a puppy.... I got him his appointment in the ser ice," said the prince disdainfully. "Why his son is coming I don't understand.

Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know. I don't want him." (He looked at his blushing daughter.)

"Are you unwell today? Eh?

Afraid of the 'minister' as that idiot Alpatych called him this morning?"

"No, mon pere."

Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the conser atories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and after the soup the prince became more genial.

After dinner, he went to see his daughter in law.

The little princess was sitting at a small table, chattering with Masha, her maid.

She grew pale on seeing her father in law.

She was much altered.

She was now plain rather than pretty.

Her cheeks had sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down.

"Yes, I feel a kind of oppression," she said in reply to the prince's question as to how she felt.

"Do you want anything?"

"No, merci, mon pere."

"Well, all right, all right."

He left the room and went to the waiting room where Alpatych stood with bowed head.

"Has the snow been sho eled back?"

"Yes, your excellency. Forgi e me for hea en's sake...

It was only my stupidity." "All right, all right," interrupted the prince, and laughing his unnatural way, he stretched out his hand for Alpatych to kiss, and then proceeded to his study.

Prince  asili arri ed that e ening.

He was met in the a enue by coachmen and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to one of the lodges o er the road purposely laden with snow.

Prince  asili and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.

Anatole, ha ing taken off his o ercoat, sat with arms akimbo before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent mindedly fixed his large and handsome eyes.

He regarded his whole life as a continual round of amusement which someone for some reason had to pro ide for him.

And he looked on this  isit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly heiress in the same way.

All this might, he thought, turn out  ery well and amusingly.

"And why not marry her if she really has so much money?

That ne er does any harm," thought Anatole.

He sha ed and scented himself with the care and elegance which had become habitual to him and, his handsome head held high, entered his father's room with the good humored and  ictorious air natural to him.

Prince  asili's two  alets were busy dressing him, and he looked round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter entered, as if to say 

"Yes, that's how I want you to look."

"I say, Father, joking apart, is she  ery hideous?"

Anatole asked, as if continuing a con ersation the subject of which had often been mentioned during the journey.

"Enough!

What nonsense!

Abo e all, try to be respectful and cautious with the old prince."

"If he starts a row I'll go away," said Prince Anatole. "I can't bear those old men!

Eh?"

"Remember, for you e erything depends on this."

In the meantime, not only was it known in the maidser ants' rooms that the minister and his son had arri ed, but the appearance of both had been minutely described.

Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room,  ainly trying to master her agitation.

"Why did they write, why did Lise tell me about it?

It can ne er happen!" she said, looking at herself in the glass. "How shall I enter the drawing room?

E en if I like him I can't now be myself with him."

The mere thought of her father's look filled her with terror.

The little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne had already recei ed from Masha, the lady's maid, the necessary report of how handsome the minister's son was, with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows, and with what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed him like an eagle, three steps at a time.

Ha ing recei ed this information, the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne, whose chattering  oices had reached her from the corridor, went into Princess Mary's room.

"You know they' e come, Marie?" said the little princess, waddling in, and sinking hea ily into an armchair.

She was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning, but had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was carefully done and her face was animated, which, howe er, did not conceal its sunken and faded outlines.

Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become.

Some unobtrusi e touch had been added to Mademoiselle Bourienne's toilet which rendered her fresh and pretty face yet more attracti e.

"What! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?" she began.

"They'll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we shall ha e to go down, and you ha e not smartened yourself up at all!"

The little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and merrily began to de ise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary should be dressed.

Princess Mary's self esteem was wounded by the fact that the arri al of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both her companions' not ha ing the least conception that it could be otherwise.

To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to dress her would prolong their banter and insistence.

She flushed, her beautiful eyes grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it took on the unattracti e martyrlike expression it so often wore, as she submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise.

Both these women quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty.

She was so plain that neither of them could think of her as a ri al, so they began dressing her with perfect sincerity, and with the nai e and firm con iction women ha e that dress can make a face pretty.

"No really, my dear, this dress is not pretty," said Lise, looking sideways at Princess Mary from a little distance. "You ha e a maroon dress, ha e it fetched.

Really!

You know the fate of your whole life may be at stake.

But this one is too light, it's not becoming!"

It was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary that was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little princess felt this  they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged lower on the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well.

They forgot that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered, and that howe er they might change the setting and adornment of that face, it would still remain piteous and plain.

After two or three changes to which Princess Mary meekly submitted, just as her hair had been arranged on the top of her head (a style that quite altered and spoiled her looks) and she had put on a maroon dress with a pale blue scarf, the little princess walked twice round her, now adjusting a fold of the dress with her little hand, now arranging the scarf and looking at her with her head bent first on one side and then on the other.

"No, it will not do," she said decidedly, clasping her hands.

"No, Mary, really this dress does not suit you.

I prefer you in your little gray e eryday dress. Now please, do it for my sake. Katie," she said to the maid, "bring the princess her gray dress, and you'll see, Mademoiselle Bourienne, how I shall arrange it," she added, smiling with a foretaste of artistic pleasure.

But when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained sitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in the mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth qui ering, ready to burst into sobs.

"Come, dear princess," said Mademoiselle Bourienne, "just one more little effort."

The little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to Princess Mary.

"Well, now we'll arrange something quite simple and becoming," she said.

The three  oices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienne's, and Katie's, who was laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping of birds.

"No, lea e me alone," said Princess Mary.

Her  oice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds was silenced at once.

They looked at the beautiful, large, thoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at them, and understood that it was useless and e en cruel to insist.

"At least, change your coiffure," said the little princess. "Didn't I tell you," she went on, turning reproachfully to Mademoiselle Bourienne,

"Mary's is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least.

Not in the least!

Please change it." "Lea e me alone, please lea e me alone! It is all quite the same to me," answered a  oice struggling with tears.

Mademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to themsel es that Princess Mary in this guise looked  ery plain, worse than usual, but it was too late.

She was looking at them with an expression they both knew, an expression thoughtful and sad.

This expression in Princess Mary did not frighten them (she ne er inspired fear in anyone), but they knew that when it appeared on her face, she became mute and was not to be shaken in her determination.

"You will change it, won't you?" said Lise. And as Princess Mary ga e no answer, she left the room.

Princess Mary was left alone.

She did not comply with Lise's request, she not only left her hair as it was, but did not e en look in her glass.

Letting her arms fall helplessly, she sat with downcast eyes and pondered.

A husband, a man, a strong dominant and strangely attracti e being rose in her imagination, and carried her into a totally different happy world of his own.

She fancied a child, her own     such as she had seen the day before in the arms of her nurse's daughter     at her own breast, the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the child.

"But no, it is impossible, I am too ugly," she thought.

"Please come to tea.

The prince will be out in a moment," came the maid's  oice at the door.

She roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Sa iour lit by a lamp, she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments.

A painful doubt filled her soul.

Could the joy of lo e, of earthly lo e for a man, be for her?

In her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of happiness and of children, but her strongest, most deeply hidden longing was for earthly lo e.

The more she tried to hide this feeling from others and e en from herself, the stronger it grew.

"O God," she said, "how am I to stifle in my heart these temptations of the de il?

How am I to renounce fore er these  ile fancies, so as peacefully to fulfill Thy will?"

And scarcely had she put that question than God ga e her the answer in her own heart.

"Desire nothing for thyself, seek nothing, be not anxious or en ious.

Man's future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee, but li e so that thou mayest be ready for anything.

If it be God's will to pro e thee in the duties of marriage, be ready to fulfill His will."

With this consoling thought (but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing) Princess Mary sighed, and ha ing crossed herself went down, thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say.

What could all that matter in comparison with the will of God, without Whose care not a hair of man's head can fall?

CHAPTER I 

When Princess Mary came down, Prince  asili and his son were already in the drawing room, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne.

When she entered with her hea y step, treading on her heels, the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess, indicating her to the gentlemen, said  " oila Marie!" Princess Mary saw them all and saw them in detail.

She saw Prince  asili's face, serious for an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling again, and the little princess curiously noting the impression "Marie" produced on the  isitors.

And she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne, with her ribbon and pretty face, and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him, but him she could not see, she only saw something large, brilliant, and handsome mo ing toward her as she entered the room.

Prince  asili approached first, and she kissed the bold forehead that bent o er her hand and answered his question by saying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite well.

Then Anatole came up to her.

She still could not see him.

She only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly, and she touched with her lips a white forehead, o er which was beautiful light brown hair smelling of pomade.

When she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty.

Anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his uniform, his chest expanded and his back drawn in, slightly swinging one foot, and, with his head a little bent, looked with beaming face at the princess without speaking and e idently not thinking about her at all.

Anatole was not quick witted, nor ready or eloquent in con ersation, but he had the faculty, so in aluable in society, of composure and imperturbable self possession.

If a man lacking in self confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say, the effect is bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the princess' hair.

It was e ident that he could be silent in this way for a  ery long time.

"If anyone finds this silence incon enient, let him talk, but I don't want to," he seemed to say.

Besides this, in his beha ior to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity, awe, and e en lo e     a supercilious consciousness of his own superiority.

It was as if he said to them 

"I know you, I know you, but why should I bother about you?

You'd be only too glad, of course."

Perhaps he did not really think this when he met women     e en probably he did not, for in general he thought  ery little     but his looks and manner ga e that impression.

The princess felt this, and as if wishing to show him that she did not e en dare expect to interest him, she turned to his father.

The con ersation was general and animated, thanks to Princess Lise's  oice and little downy lip that lifted o er her white teeth.

She met Prince  asili with that playful manner often employed by li ely chatty people, and consisting in the assumption that between the person they so address and themsel es there are some semi pri ate, long established jokes and amusing reminiscences, though no such reminiscences really exist     just as none existed in this case.

Prince  asili readily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew Anatole, whom she hardly knew, into these amusing recollections of things that had ne er occurred.

Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared them and e en Princess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences.

"Here at least we shall ha e the benefit of your company all to oursel es, dear prince," said the little princess (of course, in French) to Prince  asili. "It's not as at Annette's   receptions where you always ran away  you remember cette chere Annette!"   Anna Pa lo na.

"Ah, but you won't talk politics to me like Annette!"

"And our little tea table?"

"Oh, yes!"

"Why is it you were ne er at Annette's?" the little princess asked Anatole. "Ah, I know, I know," she said with a sly glance, "your brother Hippolyte told me about your goings on. Oh!" and she shook her finger at him, "I ha e e en heard of your doings in Paris!"

"And didn't Hippolyte tell you?" asked Prince  asili, turning to his son and seizing the little princess' arm as if she would ha e run away and he had just managed to catch her, "didn't he tell you how he himself was pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the door?

Oh, she is a pearl among women, Princess," he added, turning to Princess Mary.

When Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.

She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole had left Paris and how he had liked that city.

Anatole answered the Frenchwoman  ery readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her about her nati e land.

When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either.

"Not at all bad!" he thought, examining her, "not at all bad, that little companion! I hope she will bring her along with her when we're married, la petite est gentille."     The little one is charming.

The old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering what he was to do.

The coming of these  isitors annoyed him.

"What are Prince  asili and that son of his to me?

Prince  asili is a shallow braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen," he grumbled to himself.

What angered him was that the coming of these  isitors re i ed in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about which he always decei ed himself.

The question was whether he could e er bring himself to part from his daughter and gi e her to a husband.

The prince ne er directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand that he would ha e to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only with his feelings but with the  ery possibility of life.

Life without Princess Mary, little as he seemed to  alue her, was unthinkable to him.

"And why should she marry?" he thought. "To be unhappy for certain.

There's Lise, married to Andrew     a better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadays     but is she contented with her lot?

And who would marry Marie for lo e?

Plain and awkward!

They'll take her for her connections and wealth.

Are there no women li ing unmarried, and e en the happier for it?"

So thought Prince Bolkonski while dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer.

Prince  asili had brought his son with the e ident intention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer.

His birth and position in society were not bad.

"Well, I' e nothing against it," the prince said to himself, "but he must be worthy of her.

And that is what we shall see."

"That is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!" he added aloud.

He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly round the company. He noticed the change in the little princess' dress, Mademoiselle Bourienne's ribbon, Princess Mary's unbecoming coiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienne's and Anatole's smiles, and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general con ersation.

"Got herself up like a fool!" he thought, looking irritably at her. "She is shameless, and he ignores her!"

He went straight up to Prince  asili.

"Well! How d'ye do? How d'ye do? Glad to see you!"

"Friendship laughs at distance," began Prince  asili in his usual rapid, self confident, familiar tone. "Here is my second son  please lo e and befriend him."

Prince Bolkonski sur eyed Anatole. "Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow!" he said. "Well, come and kiss me," and he offered his cheek.

Anatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect.

Prince Bolkonski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and, drawing up an armchair for Prince  asili, pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news.

He seemed to listen attenti ely to what Prince  asili said, but kept glancing at Princess Mary.

"And so they are writing from Potsdam already?" he said, repeating Prince  asili's last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his daughter.

"Is it for  isitors you' e got yourself up like that, eh?" said he. "Fine,  ery fine!

You ha e done up your hair in this new way for the  isitors, and before the  isitors I tell you that in future you are ne er to dare to change your way of dress without my consent."

"It was my fault, mon pere," interceded the little princess, with a blush.

"You must do as you please," said Prince Bolkonski, bowing to his daughter in law, "but she need not make a fool of herself, she's plain enough as it is."

And he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who was reduced to tears.

"On the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess  ery well," said Prince  asili.

"Now you, young prince, what's your name?" said Prince Bolkonski, turning to Anatole, "come here, let us talk and get acquainted."

"Now the fun begins," thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile beside the old prince.

"Well, my dear boy, I hear you' e been educated abroad, not taught to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me.

Now tell me, my dear boy, are you ser ing in the Horse Guards?" asked the old man, scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.

"No, I ha e been transferred to the line," said Anatole, hardly able to restrain his laughter.

"Ah! That's a good thing.

So, my dear boy, you wish to ser e the Tsar and the country?

It is wartime.

Such a fine fellow must ser e.

Well, are you off to the front?"

"No, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached... what is it I am attached to, Papa?" said Anatole, turning to his father with a laugh.

"A splendid soldier, splendid!

'What am I attached to!'

Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Prince Bolkonski, and Anatole laughed still louder.

Suddenly Prince Bolkonski frowned.

"You may go," he said to Anatole.

Anatole returned smiling to the ladies.

"And so you' e had him educated abroad, Prince  asili, ha en't you?" said the old prince to Prince  asili.

"I ha e done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there is much better than ours."

"Yes, e erything is different nowadays, e erything is changed.

The lad's a fine fellow, a fine fellow!

Well, come with me now."

He took Prince  asili's arm and led him to his study.

As soon as they were alone together, Prince  asili announced his hopes and wishes to the old prince.

"Well, do you think I shall pre ent her, that I can't part from her?" said the old prince angrily.

"What an idea! I'm ready for it tomorrow!

Only let me tell you, I want to know my son in law better.

You know my principles     e erything abo eboard?

I will ask her tomorrow in your presence  if she is willing, then he can stay on.

He can stay and I'll see." The old prince snorted.

"Let her marry, it's all the same to me!" he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son.

"I will tell you frankly," said Prince  asili in the tone of a crafty man con inced of the futility of being cunning with so keen sighted companion. "You know, you see right through people.

Anatole is no genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted lad  an excellent son or kinsman."

"All right, all right, we'll see!"

As always happens when women lead lonely li es for any length of time without male society, on Anatole's appearance all the three women of Prince Bolkonski's household felt that their life had not been real till then.

Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and obser ing immediately increased tenfold, and their life, which seemed to ha e been passed in darkness, was suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full of significance.

Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure.

The handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed all her attention.

He seemed to her kind, bra e, determined, manly, and magnanimous.

She felt con inced of that.

Thousands of dreams of a future family life continually rose in her imagination.

She dro e them away and tried to conceal them.

"But am I not too cold with him?" thought the princess. "I try to be reser ed because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him already, but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine that I do not like him."

And Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new guest.

"Poor girl, she's de ilish ugly!" thought Anatole.

Mademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatole's arri al, thought in another way.

Of course, she, a handsome young woman without any definite position, without relations or e en a country, did not intend to de ote her life to ser ing Prince Bolkonski, to reading aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary.

Mademoiselle Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed, ungainly Russian princesses, would fall in lo e with her and carry her off  and here at last was a Russian prince.

Mademoiselle Bourienne knew a story, heard from her aunt but finished in her own way, which she liked to repeat to herself.

It was the story of a girl who had been seduced, and to whom her poor mother (sa pau re mere) appeared, and reproached her for yielding to a man without being married.

Mademoiselle Bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this story to him, her seducer.

And now he, a real Russian prince, had appeared.

He would carry her away and then sa pau re mere would appear and he would marry her.

So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle Bourienne's head at the  ery time she was talking to Anatole about Paris.

It was not calculation that guided her (she did not e en for a moment consider what she should do), but all this had long been familiar to her, and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible.

The little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet, unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior moti e or any struggle, but with nai e and lighthearted gaiety.

Although in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man tired of being run after by women, his  anity was flattered by the spectacle of his power o er these three women.

Besides that, he was beginning to feel for the pretty and pro ocati e Mademoiselle Bourienne that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.

After tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was asked to play on the cla ichord.

Anatole, laughing and in high spirits, came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle Bourienne.

Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion.

Her fa orite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic.

But Anatole's expression, though his eyes were fixed on her, referred not to her but to the mo ements of Mademoiselle Bourienne's little foot, which he was then touching with his own under the cla ichord.

Mademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at Princess Mary, and in her lo ely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess.

"How she lo es me!" thought Princess Mary. "How happy I am now, and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband!

Husband? Can it be possible?" she thought, not daring to look at his face, but still feeling his eyes gazing at her.

In the e ening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole kissed Princess Mary's hand.

She did not know how she found the courage, but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her shortsighted eyes.

Turning from Princess Mary he went up and kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne's hand. (This was not etiquette, but then he did e erything so simply and with such assurance!) Mademoiselle Bourienne flushed, and ga e the princess a frightened look.

"What delicacy!" thought the princess. "Is it possible that Amelie" (Mademoiselle Bourienne) "thinks I could be jealous of her, and not  alue her pure affection and de otion to me?" She went up to her and kissed her warmly.

Anatole went up to kiss the little princess' hand.

"No! No! No!

When your father writes to tell me that you are beha ing well I will gi e you my hand to kiss.

Not till then!" she said. And smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.

CHAPTER  

They all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he got into bed, all kept awake a long time that night.

"Is he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kind     yes, kind, that is the chief thing," thought Princess Mary  and fear, which she had seldom experienced, came upon her.

She feared to look round, it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark corner.

And this someone was he     the de il     and he was also this man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.

She rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.

Mademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conser atory for a long time that e ening,  ainly expecting someone, now smiling at someone, now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pau re mere rebuking her for her fall.

The little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made.

She could not lie either on her face or on her side.

E ery position was awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than e er because Anatole's presence had  i idly recalled to her the time when she was not like that and when e erything was light and gay.

She sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy and dishe eled, beat and turned the hea y feather bed for the third time, muttering to herself.

"I told you it was all lumps and holes!" the little princess repeated. "I should be glad enough to fall asleep, so it's not my fault!" and her  oice qui ered like that of a child about to cry.

The old prince did not sleep either.

Tikhon, half asleep, heard him pacing angrily about and snorting.

The old prince felt as though he had been insulted through his daughter.

The insult was the more pointed because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he lo ed more than himself.

He kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act, but instead of that he only excited himself more and more.

"The first man that turns up     she forgets her father and e erything else, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike herself!

Glad to throw her father o er!

And she knew I should notice it.

Fr... fr... fr! And don't I see that that idiot had eyes only for Bourienne     I shall ha e to get rid of her.

And how is it she has not pride enough to see it?

If she has no pride for herself she might at least ha e some for my sake!

She must be shown that the blockhead thinks nothing of her and looks only at Bourienne.

No, she has no pride... but I'll let her see...."

The old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a mistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Mary's self esteem would be wounded and his point (not to be parted from her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this thought, he called Tikhon and began to undress.

"What de il brought them here?" thought he, while Tikhon was putting the nightshirt o er his dried up old body and gray haired chest. "I ne er in ited them.

They came to disturb my life     and there is not much of it left."

"De il take 'em!" he muttered, while his head was still co ered by the shirt.

Tikhon knew his master's habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisiti e expression of the face that emerged from the shirt.

"Gone to bed?" asked the prince.

Tikhon, like all good  alets, instincti ely knew the direction of his master's thoughts.

He guessed that the question referred to Prince  asili and his son.

"They ha e gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency."

"No good... no good..." said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his feet into his slippers and his arms into the slee es of his dressing gown, he went to the couch on which he slept.

Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne, they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance, up to the appearance of the pau re mere  they understood that they had much to say to one another in pri ate and so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone.

When Princess Mary went to her father's room at the usual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne and Anatole met in the conser atory.

Princess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation.

It seemed to her that not only did e erybody know that her fate would be decided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it.

She read this in Tikhon's face and in that of Prince  asili's  alet, who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water.

The old prince was  ery affectionate and careful in his treatment of his daughter that morning.

Princess Mary well knew this painstaking expression of her father's.

His face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched with  exation at her not understanding a sum in arithmetic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her, repeating in a low  oice the same words se eral times o er.

He came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.

"I ha e had a proposition made me concerning you," he said with an unnatural smile. "I expect you ha e guessed that Prince  asili has not come and brought his pupil with him" (for some reason Prince Bolkonski referred to Anatole as a "pupil") "for the sake of my beautiful eyes.

Last night a proposition was made me on your account and, as you know my principles, I refer it to you."

"How am I to understand you, mon pere?" said the princess, growing pale and then blushing.

"How understand me!" cried her father angrily. "Prince  asili finds you to his taste as a daughter in law and makes a proposal to you on his pupil's behalf.

That's how it's to be understood!

'How understand it'!... And I ask you!"

"I do not know what you think, Father," whispered the princess.

"I? I? What of me? Lea e me out of the question.

I'm not going to get married.

What about you? That's what I want to know."

The princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disappro al, but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be decided now or ne er.

She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze under which she felt that she could not think, but would only be able to submit from habit, and she said 

"I wish only to do your will, but if I had to express my own desire..."

She had no time to finish.

The old prince interrupted her.

"That's admirable!" he shouted. "He will take you with your dowry and take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain.

She'll be the wife, while you..."

The prince stopped.

He saw the effect these words had produced on his daughter.

She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.

"Now then, now then, I'm only joking!" he said. "Remember this, Princess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to choose.

I gi e you freedom.

Only remember that your life's happiness depends on your decision.

Ne er mind me!"

"But I do not know, Father!"

"There's no need to talk!

He recei es his orders and will marry you or anybody  but you are free to choose.... Go to your room, think it o er, and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence  yes or no.

I know you will pray o er it.

Well, pray if you like, but you had better think it o er.

Go!

Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!" he still shouted when the princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the study.

Her fate was decided and happily decided.

But what her father had said about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful.

It was untrue to be sure, but still it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of it.

She was going straight on through the conser atory, neither seeing nor hearing anything, when suddenly the well known whispering of Mademoiselle Bourienne aroused her.

She raised her eyes, and two steps away saw Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her.

With a horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole looked at Princess Mary, but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle Bourienne who had not yet seen her.

"Who's that?

Why?

Wait a moment!" Anatole's face seemed to say.

Princess Mary looked at them in silence.

She could not understand it.

At last Mademoiselle Bourienne ga e a scream and ran away. Anatole bowed to Princess Mary with a gay smile, as if in iting her to join in a laugh at this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door that led to his own apartments.

An hour later, Tikhon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince  he added that Prince  asili was also there.

When Tikhon came to her Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair.

The princess' beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bourienne's pretty face.

"No, Princess, I ha e lost your affection fore er!" said Mademoiselle Bourienne.

"Why?

I lo e you more than e er," said Princess Mary, "and I will try to do all I can for your happiness."

"But you despise me. You who are so pure can ne er understand being so carried away by passion.

Oh, only my poor mother..."

"I quite understand," answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile. "Calm yourself, my dear.

I will go to my father," she said, and went out.

Prince  asili, with one leg thrown high o er the other and a snuffbox in his hand, was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face, as if stirred to his heart's core and himself regretting and laughing at his own sensibility, when Princess Mary entered.

He hurriedly took a pinch of snuff.

"Ah, my dear, my dear!" he began, rising and taking her by both hands.

Then, sighing, he added 

"My son's fate is in your hands.

Decide, my dear, good, gentle Marie, whom I ha e always lo ed as a daughter!"

He drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye.

"Fr... fr..." snorted Prince Bolkonski.

"The prince is making a proposition to you in his pupil's     I mean, his son's     name.

Do you wish or not to be Prince Anatole Kuragin's wife?

Reply  yes or no," he shouted, "and then I shall reser e the right to state my opinion also.

Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion," added Prince Bolkonski, turning to Prince  asili and answering his imploring look. "Yes, or no?"

"My desire is ne er to lea e you, Father, ne er to separate my life from yours.

I don't wish to marry," she answered positi ely, glancing at Prince  asili and at her father with her beautiful eyes.

"Humbug! Nonsense!

Humbug, humbug, humbug!" cried Prince Bolkonski, frowning and taking his daughter's hand  he did not kiss her, but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so that she winced and uttered a cry.

Prince  asili rose.

"My dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall ne er, ne er forget. But, my dear, will you not gi e us a little hope of touching this heart, so kind and generous?

Say 'perhaps'... The future is so long.

Say 'perhaps.'"

"Prince, what I ha e said is all there is in my heart.

I thank you for the honor, but I shall ne er be your son's wife."

"Well, so that's finished, my dear fellow!

I am  ery glad to ha e seen you.  ery glad!

Go back to your rooms, Princess. Go!" said the old prince. " ery,  ery glad to ha e seen you," repeated he, embracing Prince  asili.

"My  ocation is a different one," thought Princess Mary. "My  ocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the happiness of lo e and self sacrifice.

And cost what it may, I will arrange poor Amelie's happiness, she lo es him so passionately, and so passionately repents.

I will do all I can to arrange the match between them.

If he is not rich I will gi e her the means  I will ask my father and Andrew.

I shall be so happy when she is his wife.

She is so unfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless!

And, oh God, how passionately she must lo e him if she could so far forget herself!

Perhaps I might ha e done the same!..." thought Princess Mary.

CHAPTER  I

It was long since the Rosto s had news of Nicholas. Not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son's handwriting.

On recei ing it, he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and haste, trying to escape notice, closed the door, and began to read the letter.

Anna Mikhaylo na, who always knew e erything that passed in the house, on hearing of the arri al of the letter went softly into the room and found the count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing at the same time.

Anna Mikhaylo na, though her circumstances had impro ed, was still li ing with the Rosto s.

"My dear friend?" said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry, prepared to sympathize in any way.

The count sobbed yet more.

"Nikolenka... a letter... wa... a... s... wounded... my darling boy... the countess... promoted to be an officer... thank God... How tell the little countess!"

Anna Mikhaylo na sat down beside him, with her own handkerchief wiped the tears from his eyes and from the letter, then ha ing dried her own eyes she comforted the count, and decided that at dinner and till teatime she would prepare the countess, and after tea, with God's help, would inform her.

At dinner Anna Mikhaylo na talked the whole time about the war news and about Nikolenka, twice asked when the last letter had been recei ed from him, though she knew that already, and remarked that they might  ery likely be getting a letter from him that day.

Each time that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at Anna Mikhaylo na, the latter  ery adroitly turned the con ersation to insignificant matters.

Natasha, who, of the whole family, was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of intonation, look, and expression, pricked up her ears from the beginning of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her father and Anna Mikhaylo na, that it had something to do with her brother, and that Anna Mikhaylo na was preparing them for it.

Bold as she was, Natasha, who knew how sensiti e her mother was to anything relating to Nikolenka, did not  enture to ask any questions at dinner, but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her go erness' remarks.

After dinner, she rushed head long after Anna Mikhaylo na and, dashing at her, flung herself on her neck as soon as she o ertook her in the sitting room.

"Auntie, darling, do tell me what it is!"

"Nothing, my dear."

"No, dearest, sweet one, honey, I won't gi e up     I know you know something."

Anna Mikhaylo na shook her head.

"You are a little slyboots," she said.

"A letter from Nikolenka!

I'm sure of it!" exclaimed Natasha, reading confirmation in Anna Mikhaylo na's face.

"But for God's sake, be careful, you know how it may affect your mamma."

"I will, I will, only tell me!

You won't?

Then I will go and tell at once."

Anna Mikhaylo na, in a few words, told her the contents of the letter, on condition that she should tell no one.

"No, on my true word of honor," said Natasha, crossing herself,

"I won't tell anyone!" and she ran off at once to Sonya.

"Nikolenka... wounded... a letter," she announced in gleeful triumph.

"Nicholas!" was all Sonya said, instantly turning white. Natasha, seeing the impression the news of her brother's wound produced on Sonya, felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the news.

She rushed to Sonya, hugged her, and began to cry. "A little wound, but he has been made an officer  he is well now, he wrote himself," said she through her tears.

"There now! It's true that all you women are crybabies," remarked Petya, pacing the room with large, resolute strides. "Now I'm  ery glad,  ery glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself so.

You are all blubberers and understand nothing." Natasha smiled through her tears.

"You ha en't read the letter?" asked Sonya.

"No, but she said that it was all o er and that he's now an officer."

"Thank God!" said Sonya, crossing herself. "But perhaps she decei ed you.

Let us go to Mamma."

Petya paced the room in silence for a time.

"If I'd been in Nikolenka's place I would ha e killed e en more of those Frenchmen," he said. "What nasty brutes they are!

I'd ha e killed so many that there'd ha e been a heap of them."

"Hold your tongue, Petya, what a goose you are!"

"I'm not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles," said Petya.

"Do you remember him?" Natasha suddenly asked, after a moment's silence.

Sonya smiled.

"Do I remember Nicholas?"

"No, Sonya, but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly, remember e erything?" said Natasha, with an expressi e gesture, e idently wishing to gi e her words a  ery definite meaning. "I remember Nikolenka too, I remember him well," she said. "But I don't remember Boris.

I don't remember him a bit."

"What!

You don't remember Boris?" asked Sonya in surprise.

"It's not that I don't remember     I know what he is like, but not as I remember Nikolenka.

Him     I just shut my eyes and remember, but Boris... No!" (She shut her eyes.) "No! there's nothing at all."

"Oh, Natasha!" said Sonya, looking ecstatically and earnestly at her friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to say and as if she were saying it to someone else, with whom joking was out of the question, "I am in lo e with your brother once for all and, whate er may happen to him or to me, shall ne er cease to lo e him as long as I li e."

Natasha looked at Sonya with wondering and inquisiti e eyes, and said nothing.

She felt that Sonya was speaking the truth, that there was such lo e as Sonya was speaking of. But Natasha had not yet felt anything like it.

She belie ed it could be, but did not understand it.

"Shall you write to him?" she asked.

Sonya became thoughtful.

The question of how to write to Nicholas, and whether she ought to write, tormented her.

Now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of herself and, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on himself?

"I don't know. I think if he writes, I will write too," she said, blushing.

"And you won't feel ashamed to write to him?"

Sonya smiled.

"No."

"And I should be ashamed to write to Boris. I'm not going to."

"Why should you be ashamed?" "Well, I don't know.

It's awkward and would make me ashamed."

"And I know why she'd be ashamed," said Petya, offended by Natasha's pre ious remark. "It's because she was in lo e with that fat one in spectacles" (that was how Petya described his namesake, the new Count Bezukho ) "and now she's in lo e with that singer" (he meant Natasha's Italian singing master), "that's why she's ashamed!"

"Petya, you're a stupid!" said Natasha.

"Not more stupid than you, madam," said the nine year old Petya, with the air of an old brigadier.

The countess had been prepared by Anna Mikhaylo na's hints at dinner.

On retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears kept coming into her eyes.

Anna Mikhaylo na, with the letter, came on tiptoe to the countess' door and paused.

"Don't come in," she said to the old count who was following her. "Come later." And she went in, closing the door behind her.

The count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.

At first he heard the sound of indifferent  oices, then Anna Mikhaylo na's  oice alone in a long speech, then a cry, then silence, then both  oices together with glad intonations, and then footsteps. Anna Mikhaylo na opened the door.

Her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the public to appreciate his skill.

"It is done!" she said to the count, pointing triumphantly to the countess, who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and in the other the letter, and pressing them alternately to her lips.

When she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him, embraced his bald head, o er which she again looked at the letter and the portrait, and in order to press them again to her lips, she slightly pushed away the bald head.

 era, Natasha, Sonya, and Petya now entered the room, and the reading of the letter began.

After a brief description of the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part, and his promotion, Nicholas said that he kissed his father's and mother's hands asking for their blessing, and that he kissed  era, Natasha, and Petya.

Besides that, he sent greetings to Monsieur Schelling, Madame Schoss, and his old nurse, and asked them to kiss for him "dear Sonya, whom he lo ed and thought of just the same as e er."

When she heard this Sonya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and, unable to bear the looks turned upon her, ran away into the dancing hall, whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon, and, flushed and smiling, plumped down on the floor.

The countess was crying.

"Why are you crying, Mamma?" asked  era. "From all he says one should be glad and not cry."

This was quite true, but the count, the countess, and Natasha looked at her reproachfully.

"And who is it she takes after?" thought the countess.

Nicholas' letter was read o er hundreds of times, and those who were considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she did not let it out of her hands.

The tutors came, and the nurses, and Dmitri, and se eral acquaintances, and the countess reread the letter each time with fresh pleasure and each time disco ered in it fresh proofs of Nikolenka's  irtues.

How strange, how extraordinary, how joyful it seemed, that her son, the scarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her, that son about whom she used to ha e quarrels with the too indulgent count, that son who had first learned to say "pear" and then "granny," that this son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings, a manly warrior doing some kind of man's work of his own, without help or guidance.

The uni ersal experience of ages, showing that children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood, did not exist for the countess.

Her son's growth toward manhood, at each of its stages, had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had ne er existed the millions of human beings who grew up in the same way.

As twenty years before, it seemed impossible that the little creature who li ed somewhere under her heart would e er cry, suck her breast, and begin to speak, so now she could not belie e that that little creature could be this strong, bra e man, this model son and officer that, judging by this letter, he now was.

"What a style! How charmingly he describes!" said she, reading the descripti e part of the letter. "And what a soul!

Not a word about himself.... Not a word!

About some Deniso  or other, though he himself, I dare say, is bra er than any of them.

He says nothing about his sufferings.

What a heart!

How like him it is!

And how he has remembered e erybody!

Not forgetting anyone.

I always said when he was only so high     I always said...."

For more than a week preparations were being made, rough drafts of letters to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied out, while under the super ision of the countess and the solicitude of the count, money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment of the newly commissioned officer were collected.

Anna Mikhaylo na, practical woman that she was, had e en managed by fa or with army authorities to secure ad antageous means of communication for herself and her son.

She had opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand Duke Constantine Pa lo ich, who commanded the Guards.

The Rosto s supposed that The Russian Guards, Abroad, was quite a definite address, and that if a letter reached the Grand Duke in command of the Guards there was no reason why it should not reach the Pa lograd regiment, which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood. And so it was decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Duke's courier to Boris and Boris was to forward them to Nicholas.

The letters were from the old count, the countess, Petya,  era, Natasha, and Sonya, and finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and  arious other things the old count sent to his son.

CHAPTER  II

On the twelfth of No ember, Kutuzo 's acti e army, in camp before Olmutz, was preparing to be re iewed next day by the two Emperors     the Russian and the Austrian.

The Guards, just arri ed from Russia, spent the night ten miles from Olmutz and next morning were to come straight to the re iew, reaching the field at Olmutz by ten o'clock.

That day Nicholas Rosto  recei ed a letter from Boris, telling him that the Ismaylo  regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from Olmutz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him.

Rosto  was particularly in need of money now that the troops, after their acti e ser ice, were stationed near Olmutz and the camp swarmed with well pro isioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering all sorts of tempting wares.

The Pa lograds held feast after feast, celebrating awards they had recei ed for the campaign, and made expeditions to Olmutz to  isit a certain Caroline the Hungarian, who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses.

Rosto , who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought Deniso 's horse, Bedouin, was in debt all round, to his comrades and the sutlers.

On recei ing Boris' letter he rode with a fellow officer to Olmutz, dined there, drank a bottle of wine, and then set off alone to the Guards' camp to find his old playmate.

Rosto  had not yet had time to get his uniform.

He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated with a soldier's cross, equally shabby cadet's riding breeches lined with worn leather, and an officer's saber with a sword knot. The Don horse he was riding was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign, and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head.

As he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress Boris and all his comrades of the Guards by his appearance     that of a fighting hussar who had been under fire.

The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading their cleanliness and discipline.

They had come by easy stages, their knapsacks con eyed on carts, and the Austrian authorities had pro ided excellent dinners for the officers at e ery halting place.

The regiments had entered and left the town with their bands playing, and by the Grand Duke's orders the men had marched all the way in step (a practice on which the Guards prided themsel es), the officers on foot and at their proper posts.

Boris had been quartered, and had marched all the way, with Berg who was already in command of a company.

Berg, who had obtained his captaincy during the campaign, had gained the confidence of his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters  ery satisfactorily. Boris, during the campaign, had made the acquaintance of many persons who might pro e useful to him, and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become acquainted with Prince Andrew Bolkonski, through whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in chief's staff.

Berg and Boris, ha ing rested after yesterday's march, were sitting, clean and neatly dressed, at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them, playing chess.

Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees.

Boris, in the accurate way characteristic of him, was building a little pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting Berg's mo e, and watched his opponent's face, e idently thinking about the game as he always thought only of whate er he was engaged on.

"Well, how are you going to get out of that?" he remarked.

"We'll try to," replied Berg, touching a pawn and then remo ing his hand.

At that moment the door opened.

"Here he is at last!" shouted Rosto . "And Berg too!

Oh, you petisenfans, allay cushay dormir!" he exclaimed, imitating his Russian nurse's French, at which he and Boris used to laugh long ago.

"Dear me, how you ha e changed!"

Boris rose to meet Rosto , but in doing so did not omit to steady and replace some chessmen that were falling. He was about to embrace his friend, but Nicholas a oided him. With that peculiar feeling of youth, that dread of beaten tracks, and wish to express itself in a manner different from that of its elders which is often insincere, Nicholas wished to do something special on meeting his friend. He wanted to pinch him, push him, do anything but kiss him     a thing e erybody did.

But notwithstanding this, Boris embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and kissed him three times.

They had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when young men take their first steps on life's road, each saw immense changes in the other, quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps.

Both had changed greatly since they last met and both were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them.

"Oh, you damned dandies!

Clean and fresh as if you'd been to a fete, not like us sinners of the line," cried Rosto , with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his  oice, new to Boris, pointing to his own mud bespattered breeches.

The German landlady, hearing Rosto 's loud  oice, popped her head in at the door.

"Eh, is she pretty?" he asked with a wink.

"Why do you shout so?

You'll frighten them!" said Boris. "I did not expect you today," he added. "I only sent you the note yesterday by Bolkonski     an adjutant of Kutuzo 's, who's a friend of mine.

I did not think he would get it to you so quickly.... Well, how are you?

Been under fire already?" asked Boris.

Without answering, Rosto  shook the soldier's Cross of St. George fastened to the cording of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged arm, glanced at Berg with a smile.

"As you see," he said.

"Indeed? Yes, yes!" said Boris, with a smile. "And we too ha e had a splendid march.

You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness rode with our regiment all the time, so that we had e ery comfort and e ery ad antage.

What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and balls! I can't tell you.

And the Tsare ich was  ery gracious to all our officers."

And the two friends told each other of their doings, the one of his hussar re els and life in the fighting line, the other of the pleasures and ad antages of ser ice under members of the Imperial family.

"Oh, you Guards!" said Rosto . "I say, send for some wine."

Boris made a grimace.

"If you really want it," said he.

He went to his bed, drew a purse from under the clean pillow, and sent for wine.

"Yes, and I ha e some money and a letter to gi e you," he added.

Rosto  took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, put both arms on the table and began to read.

After reading a few lines, he glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the letter.

"Well, they' e sent you a tidy sum," said Berg, eying the hea y purse that sank into the sofa. "As for us, Count, we get along on our pay.

I can tell you for myself..."

"I say, Berg, my dear fellow," said Rosto , "when you get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk e erything o er with, and I happen to be there, I'll go at once, to be out of your way!

Do go somewhere, anywhere... to the de il!" he exclaimed, and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face, e idently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words, he added, "Don't be hurt, my dear fellow  you know I speak from my heart as to an old acquaintance."

"Oh, don't mention it, Count! I quite understand," said Berg, getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural  oice.

"Go across to our hosts  they in ited you," added Boris.

Berg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of dust, stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards, in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander, and, ha ing assured himself from the way Rosto  looked at it that his coat had been noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.

"Oh dear, what a beast I am!" muttered Rosto , as he read the letter.

"Why?"

"Oh, what a pig I am, not to ha e written and to ha e gi en them such a fright!

Oh, what a pig I am!" he repeated, flushing suddenly. "Well, ha e you sent Gabriel for some wine?

All right let's ha e some!"

In the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to Bagration which the old countess at Anna Mikhaylo na's ad ice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son, asking him to take it to its destination and make use of it.

"What nonsense!

Much I need it!" said Rosto , throwing the letter under the table.

"Why ha e you thrown that away?" asked Boris.

"It is some letter of recommendation... what the de il do I want it for!"

"Why 'What the de il'?" said Boris, picking it up and reading the address. "This letter would be of great use to you."

"I want nothing, and I won't be anyone's adjutant."

"Why not?" inquired Boris.

"It's a lackey's job!"

"You are still the same dreamer, I see," remarked Boris, shaking his head.

"And you're still the same diplomatist!

But that's not the point... Come, how are you?" asked Rosto .

"Well, as you see.

So far e erything's all right, but I confess I should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front."

"Why?"

"Because when once a man starts on military ser ice, he should try to make as successful a career of it as possible."

"Oh, that's it!" said Rosto , e idently thinking of something else.

He looked intently and inquiringly into his friend's eyes, e idently trying in  ain to find the answer to some question.

Old Gabriel brought in the wine.

"Shouldn't we now send for Berg?" asked Boris. "He would drink with you. I can't."

"Well, send for him... and how do you get on with that German?" asked Rosto , with a contemptuous smile.

"He is a  ery,  ery nice, honest, and pleasant fellow," answered Boris.

Again Rosto  looked intently into Boris' eyes and sighed.

Berg returned, and o er the bottle of wine con ersation between the three officers became animated.

The Guardsmen told Rosto  of their march and how they had been made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad.

They spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told stories of his kindness and irascibility.

Berg, as usual, kept silent when the subject did not relate to himself, but in connection with the stories of the Grand Duke's quick temper he related with gusto how in Galicia he had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a mo ement.

With a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke had ridden up to him in a  iolent passion, shouting 

"Arnauts!" ("Arnauts" was the Tsare ich's fa orite expression when he was in a rage) and called for the company commander.

"Would you belie e it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, because I knew I was right.

Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know the Army Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lord's Prayer.

So, Count, there ne er is any negligence in my company, and so my conscience was at ease.

I came forward...." (Berg stood up and showed how he presented himself, with his hand to his cap, and really it would ha e been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self complacency than his did.) "Well, he stormed at me, as the saying is, stormed and stormed and stormed! It was not a matter of life but rather of death, as the saying is.

'Albanians!' and 'de ils!' and 'To Siberia!'" said Berg with a sagacious smile. "I knew I was in the right so I kept silent  was not that best, Count?...

'Hey, are you dumb?' he shouted.

Still I remained silent.

And what do you think, Count?

The next day it was not e en mentioned in the Orders of the Day. That's what keeping one's head means.

That's the way, Count," said Berg, lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke.

"Yes, that was fine," said Rosto , smiling.

But Boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and skillfully changed the subject.

He asked him to tell them how and where he got his wound.

This pleased Rosto  and he began talking about it, and as he went on became more and more animated.

He told them of his Schon Grabern affair, just as those who ha e taken part in a battle generally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to ha e been, as they ha e heard it described by others, and as sounds well, but not at all as it really was.

Rosto  was a truthful young man and would on no account ha e told a deliberate lie.

He began his story meaning to tell e erything just as it happened, but imperceptibly, in oluntarily, and ine itably he lapsed into falsehood.

If he had told the truth to his hearers     who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just such a story     they would either not ha e belie ed him or, still worse, would ha e thought that Rosto  was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of ca alry attacks had not happened to him.

He could not tell them simply that e eryone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a Frenchman into the wood.

Besides, to tell e erything as it really happened, it would ha e been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened.

It is  ery difficult to tell the truth, and young people are rarely capable of it.

His hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on.

And so he told them all that.

In the middle of his story, just as he was saying  "You cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack," Prince Andrew, whom Boris was expecting, entered the room.

Prince Andrew, who liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward Boris, who had managed to please him the day before, he wished to do what the young man wanted.

Ha ing been sent with papers from Kutuzo  to the Tsare ich, he looked in on Boris, hoping to find him alone.

When he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his military exploits (Prince Andrew could not endure that sort of man), he ga e Boris a pleasant smile, frowned as with half closed eyes he looked at Rosto , bowed slightly and wearily, and sat down languidly on the sofa  he felt it unpleasant to ha e dropped in on bad company.

Rosto  flushed up on noticing this, but he did not care, this was a mere stranger.

Glancing, howe er, at Boris, he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line.

In spite of Prince Andrew's disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of the contempt with which Rosto , from his fighting army point of  iew, regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was e idently one, Rosto  felt confused, blushed, and became silent.

Boris inquired what news there might be on the staff, and what, without indiscretion, one might ask about our plans.

"We shall probably ad ance," replied Bolkonski, e idently reluctant to say more in the presence of a stranger.

Berg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled.

To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that he could gi e no opinion on such an important go ernment order, and Berg laughed gaily.

"As to your business," Prince Andrew continued, addressing Boris, "we will talk of it later" (and he looked round at Rosto ). "Come to me after the re iew and we will do what is possible."

And, ha ing glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to Rosto , whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to anger he did not condescend to notice, and said 

"I think you were talking of the Schon Grabern affair?

Were you there?"

"I was there," said Rosto  angrily, as if intending to insult the aide de camp.

Bolkonski noticed the hussar's state of mind, and it amused him.

With a slightly contemptuous smile, he said 

"Yes, there are many stories now told about that affair!"

"Yes, stories!" repeated Rosto  loudly, looking with eyes suddenly grown furious, now at Boris, now at Bolkonski. "Yes, many stories! But our stories are the stories of men who ha e been under the enemy's fire! Our stories ha e some weight, not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything!"

"Of whom you imagine me to be one?" said Prince Andrew, with a quiet and particularly amiable smile.

A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man's self possession mingled at that moment in Rosto 's soul.

"I am not talking about you," he said, "I don't know you and, frankly, I don't want to.

I am speaking of the staff in general."

"And I will tell you this," Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet authority, "you wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree with you that it would be  ery easy to do so if you ha en't sufficient self respect, but admit that the time and place are  ery badly chosen.

In a day or two we shall all ha e to take part in a greater and more serious duel, and besides, Drubetskoy, who says he is an old friend of yours, is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you.

Howe er," he added rising, "you know my name and where to find me, but don't forget that I do not regard either myself or you as ha ing been at all insulted, and as a man older than you, my ad ice is to let the matter drop.

Well then, on Friday after the re iew I shall expect you, Drubetskoy. Au re oir!" exclaimed Prince Andrew, and with a bow to them both he went out.

Only when Prince Andrew was gone did Rosto  think of what he ought to ha e said.

And he was still more angry at ha ing omitted to say it.

He ordered his horse at once and, coldly taking lea e of Boris, rode home.

Should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant, or really let the matter drop, was the question that worried him all the way.

He thought angrily of the pleasure he would ha e at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when co ered by his pistol, and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew there was none he would so much like to ha e for a friend as that  ery adjutant whom he so hated.

CHAPTER  III

The day after Rosto  had been to see Boris, a re iew was held of the Austrian and Russian troops, both those freshly arri ed from Russia and those who had been campaigning under Kutuzo .

The two Emperors, the Russian with his heir the Tsare ich, and the Austrian with the Archduke, inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men.

From early morning the smart clean troops were on the mo e, forming up on the field before the fortress.

Now thousands of feet and bayonets mo ed and halted at the officers' command, turned with banners flying, formed up at inter als, and wheeled round other similar masses of infantry in different uniforms  now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the jingling of showy ca alry in blue, red, and green braided uniforms, with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black, roan, or gray horses  then again, spreading out with the brazen clatter of the polished shining cannon that qui ered on the gun carriages and with the smell of linstocks, came the artillery which crawled between the infantry and ca alry and took up its appointed position.

Not only the generals in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, and wearing scar es and all their decorations, not only the elegant, pomaded officers, but e ery soldier with his freshly washed and sha en face and his weapons clean and polished to the utmost, and e ery horse groomed till its coat shone like satin and e ery hair of its wetted mane lay smooth     felt that no small matter was happening, but an important and solemn affair.

E ery general and e ery soldier was conscious of his own insignificance, aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that enormous whole.

From early morning strenuous acti ities and efforts had begun and by ten o'clock all had been brought into due order.

The ranks were drawn up on the  ast field.

The whole army was extended in three lines  the ca alry in front, behind it the artillery, and behind that again the infantry.

A space like a street was left between each two lines of troops.

The three parts of that army were sharply distinguished  Kutuzo 's fighting army (with the Pa lograds on the right flank of the front)  those recently arri ed from Russia, both Guards and regiments of the line  and the Austrian troops.

But they all stood in the same lines, under one command, and in a like order.

Like wind o er lea es ran an excited whisper  "They're coming! They're coming!"

Alarmed  oices were heard, and a stir of final preparation swept o er all the troops.

From the direction of Olmutz in front of them, a group was seen approaching.

And at that moment, though the day was still, a light gust of wind blowing o er the army slightly stirred the streamers on the lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs.

It looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its joy at the approach of the Emperors.

One  oice was heard shouting 

"Eyes front!"

Then, like the crowing of cocks at sunrise, this was repeated by others from  arious sides and all became silent.

In the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard.

This was the Emperors' suites.

The Emperors rode up to the flank, and the trumpets of the first ca alry regiment played the general march.

It seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing, but as if the army itself, rejoicing at the Emperors' approach, had naturally burst into music.

Amid these sounds, only the youthful kindly  oice of the Emperor Alexander was clearly heard.

He ga e the words of greeting, and the first regiment roared "Hurrah!" so deafeningly, continuously, and joyfully that the men themsel es were awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted.

Rosto , standing in the front lines of Kutuzo 's army which the Tsar approached first, experienced the same feeling as e ery other man in that army  a feeling of self forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of might, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph.

He felt that at a single word from that man all this  ast mass (and he himself an insignificant atom in it) would go through fire and water, commit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and so he could not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word.

"Hurrah!

Hurrah!

Hurrah!" thundered from all sides, one regiment after another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march, and then "Hurrah!"... Then the general march, and again "Hurrah! Hurrah!" growing e er stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar.

Till the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and immobility seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became ali e, its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already passed.

Through the terrible and deafening roar of those  oices, amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone, hundreds of riders composing the suites mo ed carelessly but symmetrically and abo e all freely, and in front of them two men     the Emperors.

Upon them the undi ided, tensely passionate attention of that whole mass of men was concentrated.

The handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse Guards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud  oice, attracted e eryone's attention.

Rosto  was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight had recognized the Tsar and watched his approach.

When he was within twenty paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish e ery detail of his handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling tenderness and ecstasy such as he had ne er before known.

E ery trait and e ery mo ement of the Tsar's seemed to him enchanting.

Stopping in front of the Pa lograds, the Tsar said something in French to the Austrian Emperor and smiled.

Seeing that smile, Rosto  in oluntarily smiled himself and felt a still stronger flow of lo e for his so ereign.

He longed to show that lo e in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry.

The Tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him.

"Oh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?" thought Rosto .

"I should die of happiness!"

The Tsar addressed the officers also 

"I thank you all, gentlemen, I thank you with my whole heart." To Rosto  e ery word sounded like a  oice from hea en.

How gladly would he ha e died at once for his Tsar!

"You ha e earned the St. George's standards and will be worthy of them."

"Oh, to die, to die for him," thought Rosto .

The Tsar said something more which Rosto  did not hear, and the soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted "Hurrah!"

Rosto  too, bending o er his saddle, shouted "Hurrah!" with all his might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if only to express his rapture fully.

The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided.

"How can the Emperor be undecided?" thought Rosto , but then e en this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like e erything else the Tsar did.

That hesitation lasted only an instant.

The Tsar's foot, in the narrow pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare he rode, his hand in a white glo e gathered up the reins, and he mo ed off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides de camp.

Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at other regiments, till at last only his white plumes were  isible to Rosto  from amid the suites that surrounded the Emperors.

Among the gentlemen of the suite, Rosto  noticed Bolkonski, sitting his horse indolently and carelessly.

Rosto  recalled their quarrel of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought not to challenge Bolkonski.

"Of course not!" he now thought. "Is it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment?

At a time of such lo e, such rapture, and such self sacrifice, what do any of our quarrels and affronts matter?

I lo e and forgi e e erybody now."

When the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troops began a ceremonial march past him, and Rosto  on Bedouin, recently purchased from Deniso , rode past too, at the rear of his squadron     that is, alone and in full  iew of the Emperor.

Before he reached him, Rosto , who was a splendid horseman, spurred Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the animal went when excited.

Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest, his tail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the Emperor's eye upon him, passed splendidly, lifting his feet with a high and graceful action, as if flying through the air without touching the ground.

Rosto  himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a frowning but blissful face "like a  ewy de il," as Deniso  expressed it.

"Fine fellows, the Pa lograds!" remarked the Emperor.

"My God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire this instant!" thought Rosto .

When the re iew was o er, the newly arri ed officers, and also Kutuzo 's, collected in groups and began to talk about the awards, about the Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, about Bonaparte, and how badly the latter would fare now, especially if the Essen corps arri ed and Prussia took our side.

But the talk in e ery group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander. His e ery word and mo ement was described with ecstasy.

They all had but one wish  to ad ance as soon as possible against the enemy under the Emperor's command.

Commanded by the Emperor himself they could not fail to  anquish anyone, be it whom it might  so thought Rosto  and most of the officers after the re iew.

All were then more confident of  ictory than the winning of two battles would ha e made them.

CHAPTER IX

The day after the re iew, Boris, in his best uniform and with his comrade Berg's best wishes for success, rode to Olmutz to see Bolkonski, wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best post he could     preferably that of adjutant to some important personage, a position in the army which seemed to him most attracti e.

"It is all  ery well for Rosto , whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a time, to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyone's lackey, but I who ha e nothing but my brains ha e to make a career and must not miss opportunities, but must a ail myself of them!" he reflected.

He did not find Prince Andrew in Olmutz that day, but the appearance of the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed and the two Emperors were li ing with their suites, households, and courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world.

He knew no one, and despite his smart Guardsman's uniform, all these exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages with their plumes, ribbons, and medals, both courtiers and military men, seemed so immeasurably abo e him, an insignificant officer of the Guards, that they not only did not wish to, but simply could not, be aware of his existence.

At the quarters of the commander in chief, Kutuzo , where he inquired for Bolkonski, all the adjutants and e en the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a great many officers like him were always coming there and that e erybody was heartily sick of them.

In spite of this, or rather because of it, next day, No ember 15, after dinner he again went to Olmutz and, entering the house occupied by Kutuzo , asked for Bolkonski.

Prince Andrew was in and Boris was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for dancing, but in which fi e beds now stood, and furniture of  arious kinds  a table, chairs, and a cla ichord.

One adjutant, nearest the door, was sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, writing.

Another, the red, stout Nes itski, lay on a bed with his arms under his head, laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him.

A third was playing a  iennese waltz on the cla ichord, while a fourth, lying on the cla ichord, sang the tune.

Bolkonski was not there.

None of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing Boris.

The one who was writing and whom Boris addressed turned round crossly and told him Bolkonski was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the reception room if he wished to see him.

Boris thanked him and went to the reception room, where he found some ten officers and generals.

When he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously (with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says, "If it were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment"), was listening to an old Russian general with decorations, who stood  ery erect, almost on tiptoe, with a soldier's obsequious expression on his purple face, reporting something.

" ery well, then, be so good as to wait," said Prince Andrew to the general, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he affected when he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing Boris, Prince Andrew, paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring him to hear something more, nodded and turned to him with a cheerful smile.

At that moment Boris clearly realized what he had before surmised, that in the army, besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the military code, which he and the others knew in the regiment, there was another, more important, subordination, which made this tight laced, purple faced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andrew, for his own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant Drubetskoy.

More than e er was Boris resol ed to ser e in future not according to the written code, but under this unwritten law.

He felt now that merely by ha ing been recommended to Prince Andrew he had already risen abo e the general who at the front had the power to annihilate him, a lieutenant of the Guards.

Prince Andrew came up to him and took his hand.

"I am  ery sorry you did not find me in yesterday.

I was fussing about with Germans all day.

We went with Weyrother to sur ey the dispositions.

When Germans start being accurate, there's no end to it!"

Boris smiled, as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding to as something generally known.

But it was the first time he had heard Weyrother's name, or e en the term "dispositions."

"Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant?

I ha e been thinking about you."

"Yes, I was thinking"     for some reason Boris could not help blushing     "of asking the commander in chief. He has had a letter from Prince Kuragin about me. I only wanted to ask because I fear the Guards won't be in action," he added as if in apology.

"All right, all right. We'll talk it o er," replied Prince Andrew. "Only let me report this gentleman's business, and I shall be at your disposal."

While Prince Andrew went to report about the purple faced general, that gentleman     e idently not sharing Boris' conception of the ad antages of the unwritten code of subordination     looked so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had pre ented his finishing what he had to say to the adjutant that Boris felt uncomfortable.

He turned away and waited impatiently for Prince Andrew's return from the commander in chief's room.

"You see, my dear fellow, I ha e been thinking about you," said Prince Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the cla ichord was. "It's no use your going to the commander in chief. He would say a lot of pleasant things, ask you to dinner" ("That would not be bad as regards the unwritten code," thought Boris), "but nothing more would come of it. There will soon be a battalion of us aides de camp and adjutants!

But this is what we'll do  I ha e a good friend, an adjutant general and an excellent fellow, Prince Dolgoruko   and though you may not know it, the fact is that now Kutuzo  with his staff and all of us count for nothing. E erything is now centered round the Emperor. So we will go to Dolgoruko   I ha e to go there anyhow and I ha e already spoken to him about you. We shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you somewhere nearer the sun."

Prince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young man and help him to worldly success.

Under co er of obtaining help of this kind for another, which from pride he would ne er accept for himself, he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and which attracted him.

He  ery readily took up Boris' cause and went with him to Dolgoruko .

It was late in the e ening when they entered the palace at Olmutz occupied by the Emperors and their retinues.

That same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part.

At that council, contrary to the  iews of the old generals Kutuzo  and Prince Schwartzenberg, it had been decided to ad ance immediately and gi e battle to Bonaparte.

The council of war was just o er when Prince Andrew accompanied by Boris arri ed at the palace to find Dolgoruko .

E eryone at headquarters was still under the spell of the day's council, at which the party of the young had triumphed.

The  oices of those who counseled delay and ad ised waiting for something else before ad ancing had been so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusi e e idence of the ad antages of attacking that what had been discussed at the council     the coming battle and the  ictory that would certainly result from it     no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past.

All the ad antages were on our side.

Our enormous forces, undoubtedly superior to Napoleon's, were concentrated in one place, the troops inspired by the Emperors' presence were eager for action. The strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the Austrian General Weyrother  a lucky accident had ordained that the Austrian army should maneu er the pre ious year on the  ery fields where the French had now to be fought  the adjacent locality was known and shown in e ery detail on the maps, and Bonaparte, e idently weakened, was undertaking nothing.

Dolgoruko , one of the warmest ad ocates of an attack, had just returned from the council, tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the  ictory that had been gained.

Prince Andrew introduced his protege, but Prince Dolgoruko  politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to Boris and, e idently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in his mind at that moment, addressed Prince Andrew in French.

"Ah, my dear fellow, what a battle we ha e gained!

God grant that the one that will result from it will be as  ictorious!

Howe er, dear fellow," he said abruptly and eagerly, "I must confess to ha ing been unjust to the Austrians and especially to Weyrother.

What exactitude, what minuteness, what knowledge of the locality, what foresight for e ery e entuality, e ery possibility e en to the smallest detail!

No, my dear fellow, no conditions better than our present ones could ha e been de ised.

This combination of Austrian precision with Russian  alor     what more could be wished for?"

"So the attack is definitely resol ed on?" asked Bolkonski.

"And do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte has decidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter was recei ed from him today for the Emperor." Dolgoruko  smiled significantly.

"Is that so?

And what did he say?" inquired Bolkonski.

"What can he say?

Tra di ri di ra and so on... merely to gain time.

I tell you he is in our hands, that's certain!

But what was most amusing," he continued, with a sudden, good natured laugh, "was that we could not think how to address the reply!

If not as 'Consul' and of course not as 'Emperor,' it seemed to me it should be to 'General Bonaparte.'"

"But between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him General Bonaparte, there is a difference," remarked Bolkonski.

"That's just it," interrupted Dolgoruko  quickly, laughing. "You know Bilibin     he's a  ery cle er fellow. He suggested addressing him as 'Usurper and Enemy of Mankind.'"

Dolgoruko  laughed merrily.

"Only that?" said Bolkonski.

"All the same, it was Bilibin who found a suitable form for the address.

He is a wise and cle er fellow."

"What was it?"

"To the Head of the French Go ernment... Au chef du gou ernement francais," said Dolgoruko , with gra e satisfaction. "Good, wasn't it?"

"Yes, but he will dislike it extremely," said Bolkonski.

"Oh yes,  ery much!

My brother knows him, he's dined with him     the present Emperor     more than once in Paris, and tells me he ne er met a more cunning or subtle diplomatist     you know, a combination of French adroitness and Italian play acting!

Do you know the tale about him and Count Marko ?

Count Marko  was the only man who knew how to handle him.

You know the story of the handkerchief?

It is delightful!"

And the talkati e Dolgoruko , turning now to Boris, now to Prince Andrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to test Marko , our ambassador, purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at Marko , probably expecting Marko  to pick it up for him, and how Marko  immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching Bonaparte's.

"Delightful!" said Bolkonski. "But I ha e come to you, Prince, as a petitioner on behalf of this young man.

You see..." but before Prince Andrew could finish, an aide de camp came in to summon Dolgoruko  to the Emperor.

"Oh, what a nuisance," said Dolgoruko , getting up hurriedly and pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Boris. "You know I should be  ery glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young man." Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of good natured, sincere, and animated le ity. "But you see... another time!"

Boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers as he felt himself to be at that moment.

He was conscious that here he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous mo ements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny, obedient, and insignificant atom.

They followed Prince Dolgoruko  out into the corridor and met     coming out of the door of the Emperor's room by which Dolgoruko  had entered     a short man in ci ilian clothes with a cle er face and sharply projecting jaw which, without spoiling his face, ga e him a peculiar  i acity and shiftiness of expression.

This short man nodded to Dolgoruko  as to an intimate friend and stared at Prince Andrew with cool intensity, walking straight toward him and e idently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way.

Prince Andrew did neither  a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turned away and went down the side of the corridor.

"Who was that?" asked Boris.

"He is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant of men     the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam Czartoryski....

It is such men as he who decide the fate of nations," added Bolkonski with a sigh he could not suppress, as they passed out of the palace.

Next day, the army began its campaign, and up to the  ery battle of Austerlitz, Boris was unable to see either Prince Andrew or Dolgoruko  again and remained for a while with the Ismaylo  regiment.

CHAPTER X

At dawn on the sixteenth of No ember, Deniso 's squadron, in which Nicholas Rosto  ser ed and which was in Prince Bagration's detachment, mo ed from the place where it had spent the night, ad ancing into action as arranged, and after going behind other columns for about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad.

Rosto  saw the Cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then Generals Bagration and Dolgoruko  ride past with their adjutants.

All the fear before action which he had experienced as pre iously, all the inner struggle to conquer that fear, all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true hussar in this battle, had been wasted.

Their squadron remained in reser e and Nicholas Rosto  spent that day in a dull and wretched mood.

At nine in the morning, he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah, and saw wounded being brought back (there were not many of them), and at last he saw how a whole detachment of French ca alry was brought in, con oyed by a sotnya of Cossacks.

E idently the affair was o er and, though not big, had been a successful engagement.

The men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant  ictory, of the occupation of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole French squadron.

The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost, and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of  ictory which was con eyed, not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers, officers, generals, and adjutants, as they passed Rosto  going or coming.

And Nicholas, who had  ainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inacti ity, was all the more depressed.

"Come here, Wosto . Let's dwink to dwown our gwief!" shouted Deniso , who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some food.

The officers gathered round Deniso 's canteen, eating and talking. "There!

They are bringing another!" cried one of the officers, indicating a capti e French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by two Cossacks.

One of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had taken from the prisoner.

"Sell us that horse!" Deniso  called out to the Cossacks.

"If you like, your honor!"

The officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner.

The French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German accent.

He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when he heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers, addressing first one, then another.

He said he would not ha e been taken, it was not his fault but the corporal's who had sent him to seize some horsecloths, though he had told him the Russians were there.

And at e ery word he added  "But don't hurt my little horse!" and stroked the animal.

It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was.

Now he excused himself for ha ing been taken prisoner and now, imagining himself before his own officers, insisted on his soldierly discipline and zeal in the ser ice.

He brought with him into our rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the French army, which was so alien to us.

The Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and Rosto , being the richest of the officers now that he had recei ed his money, bought it.

"But don't hurt my little horse!" said the Alsatian good naturedly to Rosto  when the animal was handed o er to the hussar.

Rosto  smilingly reassured the dragoon and ga e him money.

"Alley!

Alley!" said the Cossack, touching the prisoner's arm to make him go on.

"The Emperor!

The Emperor!" was suddenly heard among the hussars.

All began to run and bustle, and Rosto  saw coming up the road behind him se eral riders with white plumes in their hats.

In a moment e eryone was in his place, waiting.

Rosto  did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted.

Instantly his regret at not ha ing been in action and his dejected mood amid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly e ery thought of himself had  anished. He was filled with happiness at his nearness to the Emperor.

He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the day he had lost.

He was happy as a lo er when the longed for moment of meeting arri es.

Not daring to look round and without looking round, he was ecstatically conscious of his approach.

He felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of the approaching ca alcade, but because as he drew near e erything grew brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more festi e around him.

Nearer and nearer to Rosto  came that sun shedding beams of mild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself en eloped in those beams, he heard his  oice, that kindly, calm, and majestic  oice that was yet so simple!

And as if in accord with Rosto 's feeling, there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard the Emperor's  oice.

"The Pa lograd hussars?" he inquired.

"The reser es, sire!" replied a  oice, a  ery human one compared to that which had said  "The Pa lograd hussars?"

The Emperor drew le el with Rosto  and halted.

Alexander's face was e en more beautiful than it had been three days before at the re iew.

It shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that it suggested the li eliness of a fourteen year old boy, and yet it was the face of the majestic Emperor.

Casually, while sur eying the squadron, the Emperor's eyes met Rosto 's and rested on them for not more than two seconds.

Whether or no the Emperor understood what was going on in Rosto 's soul (it seemed to Rosto  that he understood e erything), at any rate his light blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into Rosto 's face. A gentle, mild light poured from them. Then all at once he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse with his left foot, and galloped on.

The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twel e o'clock left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward the  anguard.

Before he came up with the hussars, se eral adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action.

This battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, was represented as a brilliant  ictory o er the French, and so the Emperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung o er the battlefield, belie ed that the French had been defeated and were retreating against their will.

A few minutes after the Emperor had passed, the Pa lograd di ision was ordered to ad ance.

In Wischau itself, a petty German town, Rosto  saw the Emperor again.

In the market place, where there had been some rather hea y firing before the Emperor's arri al, lay se eral killed and wounded soldiers whom there had not been time to mo e.

The Emperor, surrounded by his suite of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare, a different one from that which he had ridden at the re iew, and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his unco ered head.

The wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and re olting that his proximity to the Emperor shocked Rosto .

Rosto  saw how the Emperor's rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shi er had run down them, how his left foot began con ulsi ely tapping the horse's side with the spur, and how the well trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir.

An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on a stretcher that had been brought.

The soldier groaned.

"Gently, gently! Can't you do it more gently?" said the Emperor apparently suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.

Rosto  saw tears filling the Emperor's eyes and heard him, as he was riding away, say to Czartoryski 

"What a terrible thing war is  what a terrible thing!

Quelle terrible chose que la guerre!"

The troops of the  anguard were stationed before Wischau, within sight of the enemy's lines, which all day long had yielded ground to us at the least firing.

The Emperor's gratitude was announced to the  anguard, rewards were promised, and the men recei ed a double ration of  odka.

The campfires crackled and the soldiers' songs resounded e en more merrily than on the pre ious night.

Deniso  celebrated his promotion to the rank of major, and Rosto , who had already drunk enough, at the end of the feast proposed the Emperor's health. "Not 'our So ereign, the Emperor,' as they say at official dinners," said he, "but the health of our So ereign, that good, enchanting, and great man! Let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the French!"

"If we fought before," he said, "not letting the French pass, as at Schon Grabern, what shall we not do now when he is at the front?

We will all die for him gladly!

Is it not so, gentlemen?

Perhaps I am not saying it right, I ha e drunk a good deal     but that is how I feel, and so do you too!

To the health of Alexander the First!

Hurrah!"

"Hurrah!" rang the enthusiastic  oices of the officers.

And the old ca alry captain, Kirsten, shouted enthusiastically and no less sincerely than the twenty year old Rosto .

When the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, Kirsten filled others and, in shirt slee es and breeches, went glass in hand to the soldiers' bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white chest showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the light of the campfire, wa ing his uplifted arm.

"Lads! here's to our So ereign, the Emperor, and  ictory o er our enemies! Hurrah!" he exclaimed in his dashing, old, hussar's baritone.

The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts.

Late that night, when all had separated, Deniso  with his short hand patted his fa orite, Rosto , on the shoulder.

"As there's no one to fall in lo e with on campaign, he's fallen in lo e with the Tsar," he said.

"Deniso , don't make fun of it!" cried Rosto . "It is such a lofty, beautiful feeling, such a..."

"I belie e it, I belie e it, fwiend, and I share and appwo e..."

"No, you don't understand!"

And Rosto  got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of what happiness it would be to die     not in sa ing the Emperor's life (he did not e en dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his eyes.

He really was in lo e with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms and the hope of future triumph.

And he was not the only man to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle of Austerlitz  nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in lo e, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms.

CHAPTER XI

The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and  illier, his physician, was repeatedly summoned to see him.

At headquarters and among the troops near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell.

He ate nothing and had slept badly that night, those around him reported.

The cause of this indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensiti e mind by the sight of the killed and wounded.

At daybreak on the se enteenth, a French officer who had come with a flag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, was brought into Wischau from our outposts.

This officer was Sa ary.

The Emperor had only just fallen asleep and so Sa ary had to wait.

At midday he was admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off with Prince Dolgoruko  to the ad anced post of the French army.

It was rumored that Sa ary had been sent to propose to Alexander a meeting with Napoleon.

To the joy and pride of the whole army, a personal inter iew was refused, and instead of the So ereign, Prince Dolgoruko , the  ictor at Wischau, was sent with Sa ary to negotiate with Napoleon if, contrary to expectations, these negotiations were actuated by a real desire for peace.

Toward e ening Dolgoruko  came back, went straight to the Tsar, and remained alone with him for a long time.

On the eighteenth and nineteenth of No ember, the army ad anced two days' march and the enemy's outposts after a brief interchange of shots retreated.

In the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth, a great, excitedly bustling acti ity began which lasted till the morning of the twentieth, when the memorable battle of Austerlitz was fought.

Till midday on the nineteenth, the acti ity     the eager talk, running to and fro, and dispatching of adjutants     was confined to the Emperor's headquarters. But on the afternoon of that day, this acti ity reached Kutuzo 's headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns.

By e ening, the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army, and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bi ouacs to the hum of  oices, and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long.

The concentrated acti ity which had begun at the Emperor's headquarters in the morning and had started the whole mo ement that followed was like the first mo ement of the main wheel of a large tower clock.

One wheel slowly mo ed, another was set in motion, and a third, and wheels began to re ol e faster and faster, le ers and cogwheels to work, chimes to play, figures to pop out, and the hands to ad ance with regular motion as a result of all that acti ity.

Just as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the military machine, an impulse once gi en leads to the final result  and just as indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet reached.

Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and the re ol ing pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their mo ement, but a neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared to remain so for a hundred years  but the moment comes when the le er catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken.

Just as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of innumerable wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular mo ement of the hands which show the time, so the result of all the complicated human acti ities of 160,000 Russians and French     all their passions, desires, remorse, humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride, fear, and enthusiasm     was only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the so called battle of the three Emperors     that is to say, a slow mo ement of the hand on the dial of human history.

Prince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the commander in chief.

At six in the e ening, Kutuzo  went to the Emperor's headquarters and after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand marshal of the court, Count Tolstoy.

Bolkonski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the coming action from Dolgoruko .

He felt that Kutuzo  was upset and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were dissatisfied with him, and also that at the Emperor's headquarters e eryone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do not know  he therefore wished to speak to Dolgoruko .

"Well, how d'you do, my dear fellow?" said Dolgoruko , who was sitting at tea with Bilibin. "The fete is for tomorrow.

How is your old fellow? Out of sorts?"

"I won't say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he would like to be heard."

"But they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he talks sense, but to temporize and wait for something now when Bonaparte fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible."

"Yes, you ha e seen him?" said Prince Andrew. "Well, what is Bonaparte like?

How did he impress you?"

"Yes, I saw him, and am con inced that he fears nothing so much as a general engagement," repeated Dolgoruko , e idently prizing this general conclusion which he had arri ed at from his inter iew with Napoleon. "If he weren't afraid of a battle why did he ask for that inter iew? Why negotiate, and abo e all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war?

Belie e me, he is afraid, afraid of a general battle. His hour has come!

Mark my words!"

"But tell me, what is he like, eh?" said Prince Andrew again.

"He is a man in a gray o ercoat,  ery anxious that I should call him 'Your Majesty,' but who, to his chagrin, got no title from me!

That's the sort of man he is, and nothing more," replied Dolgoruko , looking round at Bilibin with a smile.

"Despite my great respect for old Kutuzo ," he continued, "we should be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so gi e him a chance to escape, or to trick us, now that we certainly ha e him in our hands!

No, we mustn't forget Su oro  and his rule     not to put yourself in a position to be attacked, but yourself to attack.

Belie e me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than all the experience of old Cunctators."

"But in what position are we going to attack him?

I ha e been at the outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are situated," said Prince Andrew.

He wished to explain to Dolgoruko  a plan of attack he had himself formed.

"Oh, that is all the same," Dolgoruko  said quickly, and getting up he spread a map on the table. "All e entualities ha e been foreseen. If he is standing before Brunn..."

And Prince Dolgoruko  rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrother's plan of a flanking mo ement.

Prince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan, which might ha e been as good as Weyrother's, but for the disad antage that Weyrother's had already been appro ed.

As soon as Prince Andrew began to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan, Prince Dolgoruko  ceased to listen to him and gazed absent mindedly not at the map, but at Prince Andrew's face.

"There will be a council of war at Kutuzo 's tonight, though  you can say all this there," remarked Dolgoruko .

"I will do so," said Prince Andrew, mo ing away from the map.

"Whate er are you bothering about, gentlemen?" said Bilibin, who, till then, had listened with an amused smile to their con ersation and now was e idently ready with a joke. "Whether tomorrow brings  ictory or defeat, the glory of our Russian arms is secure.

Except your Kutuzo , there is not a single Russian in command of a column!

The commanders are  Herr General Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le Prince de Lichtenstein, le Prince, de Hohenlohe, and finally Prishprish, and so on like all those Polish names."

"Be quiet, backbiter!" said Dolgoruko . "It is not true  there are now two Russians, Milorado ich, and Dokhturo , and there would be a third, Count Arakchee , if his ner es were not too weak."

"Howe er, I think General Kutuzo  has come out," said Prince Andrew. "I wish you good luck and success, gentlemen!" he added and went out after shaking hands with Dolgoruko  and Bilibin.

On the way home, Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking Kutuzo , who was sitting silently beside him, what he thought of tomorrow's battle.

Kutuzo  looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause, replied 

"I think the battle will be lost, and so I told Count Tolstoy and asked him to tell the Emperor.

What do you think he replied?

'But, my dear general, I am engaged with rice and cutlets, look after military matters yourself!' Yes... That was the answer I got!"

CHAPTER XII

Shortly after nine o'clock that e ening, Weyrother dro e with his plans to Kutuzo 's quarters where the council of war was to be held.

All the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in chief's and with the exception of Prince Bagration, who declined to come, were all there at the appointed time.

Weyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied and drowsy Kutuzo , who reluctantly played the part of chairman and president of the council of war.

Weyrother e idently felt himself to be at the head of a mo ement that had already become unrestrainable.

He was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a hea y cart.

Whether he was pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at headlong speed with no time to consider what this mo ement might lead to.

Weyrother had been twice that e ening to the enemy's picket line to reconnoiter personally, and twice to the Emperors, Russian and Austrian, to report and explain, and to his headquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in German, and now, much exhausted, he arri ed at Kutuzo 's.

He was e idently so busy that he e en forgot to be polite to the commander in chief. He interrupted him, talked rapidly and indistinctly, without looking at the man he was addressing, and did not reply to questions put to him. He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful, weary, and distracted air, though at the same time he was haughty and self confident.

Kutuzo  was occupying a nobleman's castle of modest dimensions near Ostralitz.

In the large drawing room which had become the commander in chief's office were gathered Kutuzo  himself, Weyrother, and the members of the council of war.

They were drinking tea, and only awaited Prince Bagration to begin the council.

At last Bagration's orderly came with the news that the prince could not attend.

Prince Andrew came in to inform the commander in chief of this and, a ailing himself of permission pre iously gi en him by Kutuzo  to be present at the council, he remained in the room.

"Since Prince Bagration is not coming, we may begin," said Weyrother, hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an enormous map of the en irons of Brunn was spread out.

Kutuzo , with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged o er his collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chair, with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms.

At the sound of Weyrother's  oice, he opened his one eye with an effort.

"Yes, yes, if you please! It is already late," said he, and nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye.

If at first the members of the council thought that Kutuzo  was pretending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that followed pro ed that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the dispositions or anything else     he was engaged in satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep.

He really was asleep.

Weyrother, with the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment, glanced at Kutuzo  and, ha ing con inced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and in a loud, monotonous  oice began to read out the dispositions for the impending battle, under a heading which he also read out 

"Dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz, No ember 30, 1805."

The dispositions were  ery complicated and difficult.

They began as follows 

"As the enemy's left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extends along Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there, while we, on the other hand, with our left wing by far outflank his right, it is ad antageous to attack the enemy's latter wing especially if we occupy the  illages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we can both fall on his flank and pursue him o er the plain between Schlappanitz and the Thuerassa forest, a oiding the defiles of Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which co er the enemy's front.

For this object it is necessary that... The first column marches... The second column marches... The third column marches..." and so on, read Weyrother.

The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions.

The tall, fair haired General Buxhowden stood, leaning his back against the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and seemed not to listen or e en to wish to be thought to listen.

Exactly opposite Weyrother, with his glistening wide open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache twisted upwards, sat the ruddy Milorado ich in a military pose, his elbows turned outwards, his hands on his knees, and his shoulders raised.

He remained stubbornly silent, gazing at Weyrother's face, and only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief of staff finished reading.

Then Milorado ich looked round significantly at the other generals.

But one could not tell from that significant look whether he agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements.

Next to Weyrother sat Count Langeron who, with a subtle smile that ne er left his typically southern French face during the whole time of the reading, gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait.

In the middle of one of the longest sentences, he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, raised his head, and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his thin lips interrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something. But the Austrian general, continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked his elbows, as if to say  "You can tell me your  iews later, but now be so good as to look at the map and listen."

Langeron lifted his eyes with an expression of perplexity, turned round to Milorado ich as if seeking an explanation, but meeting the latter's impressi e but meaningless gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.

"A geography lesson!" he muttered as if to himself, but loud enough to be heard.

Przebyszewski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his hand to his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in attention.

Dohkturo , a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with an assiduous and modest mien, and stooping o er the outspread map conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality.

He asked Weyrother se eral times to repeat words he had not clearly heard and the difficult names of  illages.

Weyrother complied and Dohkturo  noted them down.

When the reading which lasted more than an hour was o er, Langeron again brought his snuffbox to rest and, without looking at Weyrother or at anyone in particular, began to say how difficult it was to carry out such a plan in which the enemy's position was assumed to be known, whereas it was perhaps not known, since the enemy was in mo ement.

Langeron's objections were  alid but it was ob ious that their chief aim was to show General Weyrother     who had read his dispositions with as much self confidence as if he were addressing school children     that he had to do, not with fools, but with men who could teach him something in military matters.

When the monotonous sound of Weyrother's  oice ceased, Kutuzo  opened his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel is interrupted.     He listened to what Langeron said, as if remarking, "So you are still at that silly business!" quickly closed his eye again, and let his head sink still lower.

Langeron, trying as  irulently as possible to sting Weyrother's  anity as author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might easily attack instead of being attacked, and so render the whole of this plan perfectly worthless.

Weyrother met all objections with a firm and contemptuous smile, e idently prepared beforehand to meet all objections be they what they might.

"If he could attack us, he would ha e done so today," said he.

"So you think he is powerless?" said Langeron.

"He has forty thousand men at most," replied Weyrother, with the smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a case.

"In that case he is in iting his doom by awaiting our attack," said Langeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again glancing round for support to Milorado ich who was near him.

But Milorado ich was at that moment e idently thinking of anything rather than of what the generals were disputing about.

"Ma foi!" said he, "tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield."

Weyrother again ga e that smile which seemed to say that to him it was strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals and to ha e to pro e to them what he had not merely con inced himself of, but had also con inced the so ereign Emperors of.

"The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from his camp," said he. "What does that mean? Either he is retreating, which is the only thing we need fear, or he is changing his position." (He smiled ironically.)

"But e en if he also took up a position in the Thuerassa, he merely sa es us a great deal of trouble and all our arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same."

"How is that?..." began Prince Andrew, who had for long been waiting an opportunity to express his doubts.

Kutuzo  here woke up, coughed hea ily, and looked round at the generals.

"Gentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrow     or rather for today, for it is past midnight     cannot now be altered," said he. "You ha e heard them, and we shall all do our duty.

But before a battle, there is nothing more important..." he paused, "than to ha e a good sleep."

He mo ed as if to rise.

The generals bowed and retired.

It was past midnight.

Prince Andrew went out.

The council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to express his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a  ague and uneasy impression.

Whether Dolgoruko  and Weyrother, or Kutuzo , Langeron, and the others who did not appro e of the plan of attack, were right     he did not know.

"But was it really not possible for Kutuzo  to state his  iews plainly to the Emperor?

Is it possible that on account of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of li es, and my life, my life," he thought, "must be risked?"

"Yes, it is  ery likely that I shall be killed tomorrow," he thought.

And suddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series of most distant, most intimate, memories rose in his imagination  he remembered his last parting from his father and his wife  he remembered the days when he first lo ed her.

He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself, and in a ner ously emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in which he was billeted with Nes itski and began to walk up and down before it.

The night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed mysteriously.

"Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow!" he thought. "Tomorrow e erything may be o er for me! All these memories will be no more, none of them will ha e any meaning for me.

Tomorrow perhaps, e en certainly, I ha e a presentiment that for the first time I shall ha e to show all I can do."

And his fancy pictured the battle, its loss, the concentration of fighting at one point, and the hesitation of all the commanders.

And then that happy moment, that Toulon for which he had so long waited, presents itself to him at last.

He firmly and clearly expresses his opinion to Kutuzo , to Weyrother, and to the Emperors.

All are struck by the justness of his  iews, but no one undertakes to carry them out, so he takes a regiment, a di ision stipulates that no one is to interfere with his arrangements     leads his di ision to the decisi e point, and gains the  ictory alone.

"But death and suffering?" suggested another  oice.

Prince Andrew, howe er, did not answer that  oice and went on dreaming of his triumphs.

The dispositions for the next battle are planned by him alone.

Nominally he is only an adjutant on Kutuzo 's staff, but he does e erything alone.

The next battle is won by him alone.

Kutuzo  is remo ed and he is appointed... "Well and then?" asked the other  oice. "If before that you are not ten times wounded, killed, or betrayed, well... what then?..."

"Well then," Prince Andrew answered himself, "I don't know what will happen and don't want to know, and can't, but if I want this     want glory, want to be known to men, want to be lo ed by them, it is not my fault that I want it and want nothing but that and li e only for that.

Yes, for that alone!

I shall ne er tell anyone, but, oh God! what am I to do if I lo e nothing but fame and men's esteem?

Death, wounds, the loss of family     I fear nothing.

And precious and dear as many persons are to me     father, sister, wife     those dearest to me     yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I would gi e them all at once for a moment of glory, of triumph o er men, of lo e from men I don't know and ne er shall know, for the lo e of these men here," he thought, as he listened to  oices in Kutuzo 's courtyard.

The  oices were those of the orderlies who were packing up  one  oice, probably a coachman's, was teasing Kutuzo 's old cook whom Prince Andrew knew, and who was called Tit. He was saying,

"Tit, I say, Tit!"

"Well?" returned the old man.

"Go, Tit, thresh a bit!" said the wag.

"Oh, go to the de il!" called out a  oice, drowned by the laughter of the orderlies and ser ants.

"All the same, I lo e and  alue nothing but triumph o er them all, I  alue this mystic power and glory that is floating here abo e me in this mist!"

CHAPTER XIII

That same night, Rosto  was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front of Bagration's detachment.

His hussars were placed along the line in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the sleepiness that kept coming o er him.

An enormous space, with our army's campfires dimly glowing in the fog, could be seen behind him  in front of him was misty darkness.

Rosto  could see nothing, peer as he would into that foggy distance  now something gleamed gray, now there was something black, now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy ought to be, now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes.

His eyes kept closing, and in his fancy appeared     now the Emperor, now Deniso , and now Moscow memories     and he again hurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was riding, and sometimes, when he came within six paces of them, the black figures of hussars, but in the distance was still the same misty darkness.

"Why not?... It might easily happen," thought Rosto , "that the Emperor will meet me and gi e me an order as he would to any other officer  he'll say  'Go and find out what's there.'

There are many stories of his getting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching him to himself!

What if he ga e me a place near him?

Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I would unmask his decei ers!" And in order to realize  i idly his lo e de otion to the so ereign, Rosto  pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful German, whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before the Emperor.

Suddenly a distant shout aroused him.

He started and opened his eyes.

"Where am I?

Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass and watchword     shaft, Olmutz.

What a nuisance that our squadron will be in reser e tomorrow," he thought.

"I'll ask lea e to go to the front, this may be my only chance of seeing the Emperor.

It won't be long now before I am off duty.

I'll take another turn and when I get back I'll go to the general and ask him."

He readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars.

It seemed to him that it was getting lighter.

To the left he saw a sloping descent lit up, and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall.

On this knoll there was a white patch that Rosto  could not at all make out  was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or some unmelted snow, or some white houses?

He e en thought something mo ed on that white spot.

"I expect it's snow... that spot... a spot     une tache," he thought.

"There now... it's not a tache...

Natasha... sister, black eyes...

Na... tasha... (Won't she be surprised when I tell her how I' e seen the Emperor?) Natasha... take my sabretache..."     "Keep to the right, your honor, there are bushes here," came the  oice of an hussar, past whom Rosto  was riding in the act of falling asleep.

Rosto  lifted his head that had sunk almost to his horse's mane and pulled up beside the hussar.

He was succumbing to irresistible, youthful, childish drowsiness.

"But what was I thinking? I mustn't forget.

How shall I speak to the Emperor?

No, that's not it     that's tomorrow.

Oh yes!

Natasha... sabretache... saber them... Whom?

The hussars...

Ah, the hussars with mustaches. Along the T erskaya Street rode the hussar with mustaches... I thought about him too, just opposite Gurye 's house... Old Gurye .... Oh, but Deniso 's a fine fellow.

But that's all nonsense.

The chief thing is that the Emperor is here.

How he looked at me and wished to say something, but dared not.... No, it was I who dared not.

But that's nonsense, the chief thing is not to forget the important thing I was thinking of.

Yes, Na tasha, sabretache, oh, yes, yes!

That's right!" And his head once more sank to his horse's neck.

All at once it seemed to him that he was being fired at.

"What?

What?

What?... Cut them down!

What?..." said Rosto , waking up.

At the moment he opened his eyes he heard in front of him, where the enemy was, the long drawn shouts of thousands of  oices.

His horse and the horse of the hussar near him pricked their ears at these shouts.

O er there, where the shouting came from, a fire flared up and went out again, then another, and all along the French line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louder and louder.

Rosto  could hear the sound of French words but could not distinguish them.

The din of many  oices was too great  all he could hear was  "ahahah!" and "rrrr!"

"What's that?

What do you make of it?" said Rosto  to the hussar beside him. "That must be the enemy's camp!"

The hussar did not reply.

"Why, don't you hear it?" Rosto  asked again, after waiting for a reply.

"Who can tell, your honor?" replied the hussar reluctantly.

"From the direction, it must be the enemy," repeated Rosto .

"It may be he or it may be nothing," muttered the hussar. "It's dark...

Steady!" he cried to his fidgeting horse.

Rosto 's horse was also getting resti e  it pawed the frozen ground, pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights.

The shouting grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army of se eral thousand men could produce.

The lights spread farther and farther, probably along the line of the French camp.

Rosto  no longer wanted to sleep.

The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a stimulating effect on him. " i e l'Empereur! L'Empereur!" he now heard distinctly.

"They can't be far off, probably just beyond the stream," he said to the hussar beside him.

The hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily.

The sound of horse's hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was heard, and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars suddenly appeared, looming huge as an elephant.

"Your honor, the generals!" said the sergeant, riding up to Rosto .

Rosto , still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, rode with the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line.

One was on a white horse.

Prince Bagration and Prince Dolgoruko  with their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lights and shouts in the enemy's camp.

Rosto  rode up to Bagration, reported to him, and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were saying.

"Belie e me," said Prince Dolgoruko , addressing Bagration, "it is nothing but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to kindle fires and make a noise to decei e us."

"Hardly," said Bagration. "I saw them this e ening on that knoll  if they had retreated they would ha e withdrawn from that too....

Officer!" said Bagration to Rosto , "are the enemy's skirmishers still there?"

"They were there this e ening, but now I don't know, your excellency.

Shall I go with some of my hussars to see?" replied Rosto .

Bagration stopped and, before replying, tried to see Rosto 's face in the mist.

"Well, go and see," he said, after a pause.

"Yes, sir."

Rosto  spurred his horse, called to Sergeant Fedchenko and two other hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction from which the shouting came.

He felt both frightened and pleased to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance where no one had been before him.

Bagration called to him from the hill not to go beyond the stream, but Rosto  pretended not to hear him and did not stop but rode on and on, continually mistaking bushes for trees and gullies for men and continually disco ering his mistakes.

Ha ing descended the hill at a trot, he no longer saw either our own or the enemy's fires, but heard the shouting of the French more loudly and distinctly.

In the  alley he saw before him something like a ri er, but when he reached it he found it was a road.

Ha ing come out onto the road he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride o er the black field up the hillside.

To keep to the road which gleamed white in the mist would ha e been safer because it would be easier to see people coming along it.

"Follow me!" said he, crossed the road, and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point where the French pickets had been standing that e ening.

"Your honor, there he is!" cried one of the hussars behind him.

And before Rosto  had time to make out what the black thing was that had suddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report, and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plainti e sound passed out of hearing.

Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan.

Rosto  turned his horse and galloped back.

Four more reports followed at inter als, and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in different tones.

Rosto  reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen, like his own, at the firing, and went back at a footpace.

"Well, some more! Some more!" a merry  oice was saying in his soul.

But no more shots came.

Only when approaching Bagration did Rosto  let his horse gallop again, and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.

Dolgoruko  was still insisting that the French had retreated and had only lit fires to decei e us.

"What does that pro e?" he was saying as Rosto  rode up. "They might retreat and lea e the pickets."

"It's plain that they ha e not all gone yet, Prince," said Bagration. "Wait till tomorrow morning, we'll find out e erything tomorrow."

"The picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just where it was in the e ening," reported Rosto , stooping forward with his hand at the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride and especially by the sound of the bullets.

" ery good,  ery good," said Bagration. "Thank you, officer."

"Your excellency," said Rosto , "may I ask a fa or?"

"What is it?"

"Tomorrow our squadron is to be in reser e. May I ask to be attached to the first squadron?"

"What's your name?"

"Count Rosto ."

"Oh,  ery well, you may stay in attendance on me."

"Count Ilya Rosto 's son?" asked Dolgoruko .

But Rosto  did not reply.

"Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?"

"I will gi e the order."

"Tomorrow  ery likely I may be sent with some message to the Emperor," thought Rosto . "Thank God!"

The fires and shouting in the enemy's army were occasioned by the fact that while Napoleon's proclamation was being read to the troops the Emperor himself rode round his bi ouacs.

The soldiers, on seeing him, lit wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, " i e l'Empereur!"

Napoleon's proclamation was as follows 

Soldiers!

The Russian army is ad ancing against you to a enge the Austrian army of Ulm.

They are the same battalions you broke at Hollabrunn and ha e pursued e er since to this place.

The position we occupy is a strong one, and while they are marching to go round me on the right they will expose a flank to me.

Soldiers!

I will myself direct your battalions.

I will keep out of fire if you with your habitual  alor carry disorder and confusion into the enemy's ranks, but should  ictory be in doubt, e en for a moment, you will see your Emperor exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy, for there must be no doubt of  ictory, especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of the French infantry, so necessary to the honor of our nation.

Do not break your ranks on the plea of remo ing the wounded!

Let e ery man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings of England, inspired by such hatred of our nation!

This  ictory will conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters, where fresh French troops who are being raised in France will join us, and the peace I shall conclude will be worthy of my people, of you, and of myself.

NAPOLEON

CHAPTER XI 

At fi e in the morning it was still quite dark.

The troops of the center, the reser es, and Bagration's right flank had not yet mo ed, but on the left flank the columns of infantry, ca alry, and artillery, which were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the French right flank and dri e it into the Bohemian mountains according to plan, were already up and astir.

The smoke of the campfires, into which they were throwing e erything superfluous, made the eyes smart.

It was cold and dark.

The officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting, the soldiers, munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm themsel es, gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the remains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels, tubs, and e erything that they did not want or could not carry away with them.

Austrian column guides were mo ing in and out among the Russian troops and ser ed as heralds of the ad ance.

As soon as an Austrian officer showed himself near a commanding officer's quarters, the regiment began to mo e  the soldiers ran from the fires, thrust their pipes into their boots, their bags into the carts, got their muskets ready, and formed rank.

The officers buttoned up their coats, buckled on their swords and pouches, and mo ed along the ranks shouting. The train dri ers and orderlies harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads.

The adjutants and battalion and regimental commanders mounted, crossed themsel es, ga e final instructions, orders, and commissions to the baggage men who remained behind, and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded.

The column mo ed forward without knowing where and unable, from the masses around them, the smoke and the increasing fog, to see either the place they were lea ing or that to which they were going.

A soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as much as a sailor is by his ship.

Howe er far he has walked, whate er strange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches, just as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks, masts, and rigging of his ship, so the soldier always has around him the same comrades, the same ranks, the same sergeant major I an Mitrich, the same company dog Jack, and the same commanders.

The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship is sailing, but on the day of battle     hea en knows how and whence     a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army, announcing the approach of something decisi e and solemn, and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity.

On the day of battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning what is going on around them.

The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could not see ten paces ahead.

Bushes looked like gigantic trees and le el ground like cliffs and slopes.

Anywhere, on any side, one might encounter an enemy in isible ten paces off.

But the columns ad anced for a long time, always in the same fog, descending and ascending hills, a oiding gardens and enclosures, going o er new and unknown ground, and nowhere encountering the enemy.

On the contrary, the soldiers became aware that in front, behind, and on all sides, other Russian columns were mo ing in the same direction.

E ery soldier felt glad to know that to the unknown place where he was going, many more of our men were going too.

"There now, the Kurskies ha e also gone past," was being said in the ranks.

"It's wonderful what a lot of our troops ha e gathered, lads!

Last night I looked at the campfires and there was no end of them.

A regular Moscow!"

Though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to the men (the commanders, as we saw at the council of war, were out of humor and dissatisfied with the affair, and so did not exert themsel es to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders), yet the troops marched gaily, as they always do when going into action, especially to an attack.

But when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog, the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks.

How such a consciousness is communicated is  ery difficult to define, but it certainly is communicated  ery surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly, and irrepressibly, as water does in a creek.

Had the Russian army been alone without any allies, it might perhaps ha e been a long time before this consciousness of mismanagement became a general con iction, but as it was, the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid Germans, and e eryone was con inced that a dangerous muddle had been occasioned by the sausage eaters.

"Why ha e we stopped?

Is the way blocked?

Or ha e we already come up against the French?"

"No, one can't hear them.

They'd be firing if we had."

"They were in a hurry enough to start us, and now here we stand in the middle of a field without rhyme or reason. It's all those damned Germans' muddling!

What stupid de ils!"

"Yes, I'd send them on in front, but no fear, they're crowding up behind.

And now here we stand hungry."

"I say, shall we soon be clear?

They say the ca alry are blocking the way," said an officer.

"Ah, those damned Germans! They don't know their own country!" said another.

"What di ision are you?" shouted an adjutant, riding up.

"The Eighteenth."

"Then why are you here? You should ha e gone on long ago, now you won't get there till e ening."

"What stupid orders! They don't themsel es know what they are doing!" said the officer and rode off.

Then a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in Russian.

"Tafa lafa! But what he's jabbering no one can make out," said a soldier, mimicking the general who had ridden away. "I'd shoot them, the scoundrels!"

"We were ordered to be at the place before nine, but we ha en't got halfway.

Fine orders!" was being repeated on different sides.

And the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to turn into  exation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the Germans.

The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian ca alry was mo ing toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center was too far separated from our right flank and the ca alry were all ordered to turn back to the right.

Se eral thousand ca alry crossed in front of the infantry, who had to wait.

At the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a Russian general.

The general shouted a demand that the ca alry should be halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher command, was to blame.

The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited.

After an hour's delay they at last mo ed on, descending the hill.

The fog that was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below, where they were descending.

In front in the fog a shot was heard and then another, at first irregularly at  arying inter als     trata... tat     and then more and more regularly and rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach Stream began.

Not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and ha ing stumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their commanders, and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through the ranks, and abo e all being unable to see anything in front or around them in the thick fog, the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and ad anced and again halted, recei ing no timely orders from the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments.

In this way the action began for the first, second, and third columns, which had gone down into the  alley.

The fourth column, with which Kutuzo  was, stood on the Pratzen Heights.

Below, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog  on the higher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of what was going on in front.

Whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed, six miles away, or whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one knew till after eight o'clock.

It was nine o'clock in the morning.

The fog lay unbroken like a sea down below, but higher up at the  illage of Schlappanitz where Napoleon stood with his marshals around him, it was quite light.

Abo e him was a clear blue sky, and the sun's  ast orb qui ered like a huge hollow, crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist.

The whole French army, and e en Napoleon himself with his staff, were not on the far side of the streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we intended to take up our position and begin the action, but were on this side, so close to our own forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted man from one on foot.

Napoleon, in the blue cloak which he had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab horse a little in front of his marshals.

He gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the Russian troops were mo ing in the distance, and he listened to the sounds of firing in the  alley.

Not a single muscle of his face     which in those days was still thin     mo ed. His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot.

His predictions were being justified.

Part of the Russian force had already descended into the  alley toward the ponds and lakes and part were lea ing these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack and regarded as the key to the position.

He saw o er the mist that in a hollow between two hills near the  illage of Pratzen, the Russian columns, their bayonets glittering, were mo ing continuously in one direction toward the  alley and disappearing one after another into the mist.

From information he had recei ed the e ening before, from the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night, by the disorderly mo ement of the Russian columns, and from all indications, he saw clearly that the allies belie ed him to be far away in front of them, and that the columns mo ing near Pratzen constituted the center of the Russian army, and that that center was already sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked.

But still he did not begin the engagement.

Today was a great day for him     the anni ersary of his coronation.

Before dawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed,  igorous, and in good spirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy mood in which e erything seems possible and e erything succeeds.

He sat motionless, looking at the heights  isible abo e the mist, and his cold face wore that special look of confident, self complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily in lo e.

The marshals stood behind him not  enturing to distract his attention.

He looked now at the Pratzen Heights, now at the sun floating up out of the mist.

When the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and mist were aglow with dazzling light     as if he had only awaited this to begin the action     he drew the glo e from his shapely white hand, made a sign with it to the marshals, and ordered the action to begin.

The marshals, accompanied by adjutants, galloped off in different directions, and a few minutes later the chief forces of the French army mo ed rapidly toward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by Russian troops mo ing down the  alley to their left.

CHAPTER X 

At eight o'clock Kutuzo  rode to Pratzen at the head of the fourth column, Milorado ich's, the one that was to take the place of Przebyszewski's and Langeron's columns which had already gone down into the  alley.

He greeted the men of the foremost regiment and ga e them the order to march, thereby indicating that he intended to lead that column himself.

When he had reached the  illage of Pratzen he halted.

Prince Andrew was behind, among the immense number forming the commander in chief's suite.

He was in a state of suppressed excitement and irritation, though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of a long awaited moment.

He was firmly con inced that this was the day of his Toulon, or his bridge of Arcola.

How it would come about he did not know, but he felt sure it would do so.

The locality and the position of our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone in our army.

His own strategic plan, which ob iously could not now be carried out, was forgotten.

Now, entering into Weyrother's plan, Prince Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision.

To the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen forces could be heard.

It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight would concentrate. "There we shall encounter difficulties, and there," thought he, "I shall be sent with a brigade or di ision, and there, standard in hand, I shall go forward and break whate er is in front of me."

He could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions.

Seeing them he kept thinking, "That may be the  ery standard with which I shall lead the army."

In the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a hoar frost now turning to dew, but in the  alleys it still lay like a milk white sea.

Nothing was  isible in the  alley to the left into which our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing.

Abo e the heights was the dark clear sky, and to the right the  ast orb of the sun.

In front, far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist, some wooded hills were discernible, and it was there the enemy probably was, for something could be descried.

On the right the Guards were entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets  to the left beyond the  illage similar masses of ca alry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist.

In front and behind mo ed infantry.

The commander in chief was standing at the end of the  illage letting the troops pass by him.

That morning Kutuzo  seemed worn and irritable.

The infantry passing before him came to a halt without any command being gi en, apparently obstructed by something in front.

"Do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the  illage!" he said angrily to a general who had ridden up. "Don't you understand, your excellency, my dear sir, that you must not defile through narrow  illage streets when we are marching against the enemy?"

"I intended to re form them beyond the  illage, your excellency," answered the general.

Kutuzo  laughed bitterly.

"You'll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy!  ery fine!"

"The enemy is still far away, your excellency.

According to the dispositions..."

"The dispositions!" exclaimed Kutuzo  bitterly. "Who told you that?... Kindly do as you are ordered."

"Yes, sir."

"My dear fellow," Nes itski whispered to Prince Andrew, "the old man is as surly as a dog."

An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat galloped up to Kutuzo  and asked in the Emperor's name had the fourth column ad anced into action.

Kutuzo  turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall upon Prince Andrew, who was beside him.

Seeing him, Kutuzo 's male olent and caustic expression softened, as if admitting that what was being done was not his adjutant's fault, and still not answering the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolkonski.

"Go, my dear fellow, and see whether the third di ision has passed the  illage.

Tell it to stop and await my orders."

Hardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.

"And ask whether sharpshooters ha e been posted," he added. "What are they doing? What are they doing?" he murmured to himself, still not replying to the Austrian.

Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.

O ertaking the battalions that continued to ad ance, he stopped the third di ision and con inced himself that there really were no sharpshooters in front of our columns.

The colonel at the head of the regiment was much surprised at the commander in chief's order to throw out skirmishers.

He had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away.

There was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent hidden by dense mist.

Ha ing gi en orders in the commander in chief's name to rectify this omission, Prince Andrew galloped back.

Kutuzo  still in the same place, his stout body resting hea ily in the saddle with the lassitude of age, sat yawning wearily with closed eyes.

The troops were no longer mo ing, but stood with the butts of their muskets on the ground.

"All right, all right!" he said to Prince Andrew, and turned to a general who, watch in hand, was saying it was time they started as all the left flank columns had already descended.

"Plenty of time, your excellency," muttered Kutuzo  in the midst of a yawn. "Plenty of time," he repeated.

Just then at a distance behind Kutuzo  was heard the sound of regiments saluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended line of the ad ancing Russian columns.

E idently the person they were greeting was riding quickly.

When the soldiers of the regiment in front of which Kutuzo  was standing began to shout, he rode a little to one side and looked round with a frown.

Along the road from Pratzen galloped what looked like a squadron of horsemen in  arious uniforms.

Two of them rode side by side in front, at full gallop.

One in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who was in a white uniform rode a black one.

These were the two Emperors followed by their suites.

Kutuzo , affecting the manners of an old soldier at the front, ga e the command "Attention!" and rode up to the Emperors with a salute.

His whole appearance and manner were suddenly transformed.

He put on the air of a subordinate who obeys without reasoning.

With an affectation of respect which e idently struck Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted.

This unpleasant impression merely flitted o er the young and happy face of the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and  anished.

After his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of Olmutz where Bolkonski had seen him for the first time abroad, but there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his fine gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the same capacity for  arying expression and the same pre alent appearance of goodhearted innocent youth.

At the Olmutz re iew he had seemed more majestic  here he seemed brighter and more energetic.

He was slightly flushed after galloping two miles, and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round at the faces of his suite, young and animated as his own.

Czartoryski, No osiltse , Prince  olkonsky, Strogono , and the others, all richly dressed gay young men on splendid, well groomed, fresh, only slightly heated horses, exchanging remarks and smiling, had stopped behind the Emperor.

The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young man, sat  ery erect on his handsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner.

He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked some question     "Most likely he is asking at what o'clock they started," thought Prince Andrew, watching his old acquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at Brunn.

In the Emperors' suite were the picked young orderly officers of the Guard and line regiments, Russian and Austrian.

Among them were grooms leading the Tsar's beautiful relay horses co ered with embroidered cloths.

As when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a stuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulness, energy, and confidence of success reached Kutuzo 's cheerless staff with the galloping ad ent of all these brilliant young men.

"Why aren't you beginning, Michael Ilariono ich?" said the Emperor Alexander hurriedly to Kutuzo , glancing courteously at the same time at the Emperor Francis.

"I am waiting, Your Majesty," answered Kutuzo , bending forward respectfully.

The Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward as if he had not quite heard.

"Waiting, Your Majesty," repeated Kutuzo . (Prince Andrew noted that Kutuzo 's upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word "waiting.") "Not all the columns ha e formed up yet, Your Majesty."

The Tsar heard but ob iously did not like the reply  he shrugged his rather round shoulders and glanced at No osiltse  who was near him, as if complaining of Kutuzo .

"You know, Michael Ilariono ich, we are not on the Empress' Field where a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled," said the Tsar with another glance at the Emperor Francis, as if in iting him if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying. But the Emperor Francis continued to look about him and did not listen.

"That is just why I do not begin, sire," said Kutuzo  in a resounding  oice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard, and again something in his face twitched     "That is just why I do not begin, sire, because we are not on parade and not on the Empress' Field," said clearly and distinctly.

In the Emperor's suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed dissatisfaction and reproach.

"Old though he may be, he should not, he certainly should not, speak like that," their glances seemed to say.

The Tsar looked intently and obser antly into Kutuzo 's eye waiting to hear whether he would say anything more.

But Kutuzo , with respectfully bowed head, seemed also to be waiting.

The silence lasted for about a minute.

"Howe er, if you command it, Your Majesty," said Kutuzo , lifting his head and again assuming his former tone of a dull, unreasoning, but submissi e general.

He touched his horse and ha ing called Milorado ich, the commander of the column, ga e him the order to ad ance.

The troops again began to mo e, and two battalions of the No gorod and one of the Apsheron regiment went forward past the Emperor.

As this Apsheron battalion marched by, the red faced Milorado ich, without his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front and back, galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing salute reined in his horse before the Emperor.

"God be with you, general!" said the Emperor.

"Ma foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilite, sire,"   he answered gaily, raising ne ertheless ironic smiles among the gentlemen of the Tsar's suite by his poor French.   "Indeed, Sire, we shall do e erything it is possible to do, Sire."

Milorado ich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little behind the Emperor.

The Apsheron men, excited by the Tsar's presence, passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold, brisk pace.

"Lads!" shouted Milorado ich in a loud, self confident, and cheery  oice, ob iously so elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect of battle, and by the sight of the gallant Apsherons, his comrades in Su oro 's time, now passing so gallantly before the Emperors, that he forgot the so ereigns' presence. "Lads, it's not the first  illage you' e had to take," cried he.

"Glad to do our best!" shouted the soldiers.

The Emperor's horse started at the sudden cry.

This horse that had carried the so ereign at re iews in Russia bore him also here on the field of Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the Empress' Field, not understanding the significance of the firing, nor of the nearness of the Emperor Francis' black cob, nor of all that was being said, thought, and felt that day by its rider.

The Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a remark to him, pointing to the gallant Apsherons.

CHAPTER X I

Kutuzo  accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the carabineers.

When he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he stopped at a solitary, deserted house that had probably once been an inn, where two roads parted.

Both of them led downhill and troops were marching along both.

The fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly  isible about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights.

Down below, on the left, the firing became more distinct.

Kutuzo  had stopped and was speaking to an Austrian general.

Prince Andrew, who was a little behind looking at them, turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass.

"Look, look!" said this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the distance, but down the hill before him. "It's the French!"

The two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass, trying to snatch it from one another.

The expression on all their faces suddenly changed to one of horror.

The French were supposed to be a mile and a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in front of us.

"It's the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... But how is that?" said different  oices.

With the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right, not more than fi e hundred paces from where Kutuzo  was standing, a dense French column coming up to meet the Apsherons.

"Here it is! The decisi e moment has arri ed.

My turn has come," thought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to Kutuzo .

"The Apsherons must be stopped, your excellency," cried he.

But at that  ery instant a cloud of smoke spread all round, firing was heard quite close at hand, and a  oice of nai e terror barely two steps from Prince Andrew shouted, "Brothers! All's lost!"

And at this as if at a command, e eryone began to run.

Confused and e er increasing crowds were running back to where fi e minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors.

Not only would it ha e been difficult to stop that crowd, it was e en impossible not to be carried back with it oneself.

Bolkonski only tried not to lose touch with it, and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was happening in front of him.

Nes itski with an angry face, red and unlike himself, was shouting to Kutuzo  that if he did not ride away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner.

Kutuzo  remained in the same place and without answering drew out a handkerchief.

Blood was flowing from his cheek.

Prince Andrew forced his way to him.

"You are wounded?" he asked, hardly able to master the trembling of his lower jaw.

"The wound is not here, it is there!" said Kutuzo , pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers. "Stop them!" he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right.

A fresh wa e of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it.

The troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by them it was difficult to get out again.

One was shouting,

"Get on! Why are you hindering us?"

Another in the same place turned round and fired in the air  a third was striking the horse Kutuzo  himself rode.

Ha ing by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men, Kutuzo , with his suite diminished by more than half, rode toward a sound of artillery fire near by.

Ha ing forced his way out of the crowd of fugiti es, Prince Andrew, trying to keep near Kutuzo , saw on the slope of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was still firing and Frenchmen running toward it.

Higher up stood some Russian infantry, neither mo ing forward to protect the battery nor backward with the fleeing crowd.

A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and approached Kutuzo .

Of Kutuzo 's suite only four remained.

They were all pale and exchanged looks in silence.

"Stop those wretches!" gasped Kutuzo  to the regimental commander, pointing to the flying soldiers  but at that instant, as if to punish him for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across Kutuzo 's suite like a flock of little birds.

The French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kutuzo , were firing at him.

After this  olley the regimental commander clutched at his leg  se eral soldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who was holding the flag let it fall from his hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on the muskets of the nearest soldiers.

The soldiers started firing without orders.

"Oh! Oh! Oh!" groaned Kutuzo  despairingly and looked around.... "Bolkonski!" he whispered, his  oice trembling from a consciousness of the feebleness of age, "Bolkonski!" he whispered, pointing to the disordered battalion and at the enemy, "what's that?"

But before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of shame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and run to the standard.

"Forward, lads!" he shouted in a  oice piercing as a child's.

"Here it is!" thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets e idently aimed at him.

Se eral soldiers fell.

"Hurrah!" shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up the hea y standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion would follow him.

And really he only ran a few steps alone.

One soldier mo ed and then another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting "Hurrah!" and o ertook him.

A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrew's hands, but he was immediately killed.

Prince Andrew again seized the standard and, dragging it by the staff, ran on with the battalion.

In front he saw our artillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, ha ing abandoned their guns, were running toward him. He also saw French infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns round.

Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces of the cannon.

He heard the whistle of bullets abo e him unceasingly and to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped.

But he did not look at them  he looked only at what was going on in front of him     at the battery.

He now saw clearly the figure of a red haired gunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while a French soldier tugged at the other.

He could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men, who e idently did not realize what they were doing.

"What are they about?" thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them. "Why doesn't the red haired gunner run away as he is unarmed?

Why doesn't the Frenchman stab him?

He will not get away before the Frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him...."

And really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to the struggling men, and the fate of the red haired gunner, who had triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him, was about to be decided.

But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended.

It seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head with the full swing of a bludgeon.

It hurt a little, but the worst of it was that the pain distracted him and pre ented his seeing what he had been looking at.

"What's this? Am I falling? My legs are gi ing way," thought he, and fell on his back.

He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red haired gunner had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or sa ed.

But he saw nothing.

Abo e him there was now nothing but the sky     the lofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray clouds gliding slowly across it.

"How quiet, peaceful, and solemn  not at all as I ran," thought Prince Andrew     "not as we ran, shouting and fighting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frightened and angry faces struggled for the mop  how differently do those clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky!

How was it I did not see that lofty sky before?

And how happy I am to ha e found it at last!

Yes! All is  anity, all falsehood, except that infinite sky.

There is nothing, nothing, but that.

But e en it does not exist, there is nothing but quiet and peace.

Thank God!..."

CHAPTER X II

On our right flank commanded by Bagration, at nine o'clock the battle had not yet begun.

Not wishing to agree to Dolgoruko 's demand to commence the action, and wishing to a ert responsibility from himself, Prince Bagration proposed to Dolgoruko  to send to inquire of the commander in chief.

Bagration knew that as the distance between the two flanks was more than six miles, e en if the messenger were not killed (which he  ery likely would be), and found the commander in chief (which would be  ery difficult), he would not be able to get back before e ening.

Bagration cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his suite, and the boyish face Rosto , breathless with excitement and hope, was the first to catch his eye.

He sent him.

"And if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in chief, your excellency?" said Rosto , with his hand to his cap.

"You can gi e the message to His Majesty," said Dolgoruko , hurriedly interrupting Bagration.

On being relie ed from picket duty Rosto  had managed to get a few hours' sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute, with elasticity of mo ement, faith in his good fortune, and generally in that state of mind which makes e erything seem possible, pleasant, and easy.

All his wishes were being fulfilled that morning  there was to be a general engagement in which he was taking part, more than that, he was orderly to the bra est general, and still more, he was going with a message to Kutuzo , perhaps e en to the so ereign himself.

The morning was bright, he had a good horse under him, and his heart was full of joy and happiness.

On recei ing the order he ga e his horse the rein and galloped along the line.

At first he rode along the line of Bagration's troops, which had not yet ad anced into action but were standing motionless  then he came to the region occupied by U aro 's ca alry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle  ha ing passed U aro 's ca alry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and musketry ahead of him.

The firing grew louder and louder.

In the fresh morning air were now heard, not two or three musket shots at irregular inter als as before, followed by one or two cannon shots, but a roll of  olleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before Pratzen, interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes se eral of them were not separated from one another but merged into a general roar.

He could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another down the hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling, spreading, and mingling with one another.

He could also, by the gleam of bayonets  isible through the smoke, make out mo ing masses of infantry and narrow lines of artillery with green caissons.

Rosto  stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going on, but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or make out anything of what was happening  there in the smoke men of some sort were mo ing about, in front and behind mo ed lines of troops  but why, whither, and who they were, it was impossible to make out.

These sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him  on the contrary, they stimulated his energy and determination.

"Go on! Go on! Gi e it them!" he mentally exclaimed at these sounds, and again proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther and farther into the region where the army was already in action.

"How it will be there I don't know, but all will be well!" thought Rosto .

After passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the line (the Guards) was already in action.

"So much the better! I shall see it close," he thought.

He was riding almost along the front line.

A handful of men came galloping toward him.

They were our Uhlans who with disordered ranks were returning from the attack.

Rosto  got out of their way, in oluntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding, and galloped on.

"That is no business of mine," he thought.

He had not ridden many hundred yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole width of the field, an enormous mass of ca alry in brilliant white uniforms, mounted on black horses, trotting straight toward him and across his path.

Rosto  put his horse to full gallop to get out of the way of these men, and he would ha e got clear had they continued at the same speed, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of the horses were already galloping.

Rosto  heard the thud of their hoofs and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses, their figures, and e en their faces, more and more distinctly.

They were our Horse Guards, ad ancing to attack the French ca alry that was coming to meet them.

The Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their horses.

Rosto  could already see their faces and heard the command  "Charge!" shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed.

Rosto , fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the French, galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, but still was not in time to a oid them.

The last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned angrily on seeing Rosto  before him, with whom he would ine itably collide.

This Guardsman would certainly ha e bowled Rosto  and his Bedouin o er (Rosto  felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men and horses) had it not occurred to Rosto  to flourish his whip before the eyes of the Guardsman's horse.

The hea y black horse, sixteen hands high, shied, throwing back its ears  but the pockmarked Guardsman dro e his huge spurs in  iolently, and the horse, flourishing its tail and extending its neck, galloped on yet faster.

Hardly had the Horse Guards passed Rosto  before he heard them shout,

"Hurrah!" and looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign ca alry with red epaulets, probably French.

He could see nothing more, for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke en eloped e erything.

At that moment, as the Horse Guards, ha ing passed him, disappeared in the smoke, Rosto  hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where he was sent.

This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that amazed the French themsel es.

Rosto  was horrified to hear later that of all that mass of huge and handsome men, of all those brilliant, rich youths, officers and cadets, who had galloped past him on their thousand ruble horses, only eighteen were left after the charge.

"Why should I en y them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall see the Emperor immediately!" thought Rosto  and galloped on.

When he came le el with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and around them cannon balls were flying, of which he was aware not so much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers' faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the officers.

Passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he heard a  oice calling him by name.

"Rosto !"

"What?" he answered, not recognizing Boris.

"I say, we' e been in the front line!

Our regiment attacked!" said Boris with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who ha e been under fire for the first time.

Rosto  stopped.

"Ha e you?" he said. "Well, how did it go?"

"We dro e them back!" said Boris with animation, growing talkati e. "Can you imagine it?" and he began describing how the Guards, ha ing taken up their position and seeing troops before them, thought they were Austrians, and all at once disco ered from the cannon balls discharged by those troops that they were themsel es in the front line and had unexpectedly to go into action.

Rosto  without hearing Boris to the end spurred his horse.

"Where are you off to?" asked Boris.

"With a message to His Majesty."

"There he is!" said Boris, thinking Rosto  had said "His Highness," and pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high shoulders and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and Horse Guards' jacket, shouting something to a pale, white uniformed Austrian officer.

"But that's the Grand Duke, and I want the commander in chief or the Emperor," said Rosto , and was about to spur his horse.

"Count! Count!" shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager as Boris. "Count! I am wounded in my right hand" (and he showed his bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it) "and I remained at the front.

I held my sword in my left hand, Count. All our family     the  on Bergs     ha e been knights!"

He said something more, but Rosto  did not wait to hear it and rode away.

Ha ing passed the Guards and tra ersed an empty space, Rosto , to a oid again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse Guards charged, followed the line of reser es, going far round the place where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard.

Suddenly he heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops, where he could ne er ha e expected the enemy to be.

"What can it be?" he thought. "The enemy in the rear of our army?

Impossible!" And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself and for the issue of the whole battle. "But be that what it may," he reflected, "there is no riding round it now.

I must look for the commander in chief here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish with the rest."

The foreboding of e il that had suddenly come o er Rosto  was more and more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the  illage of Pratzen, which was full of troops of all kinds.

"What does it mean?

What is it?

Whom are they firing at?

Who is firing?" Rosto  kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian soldiers running in confused crowds across his path.

"The de il knows!

They' e killed e erybody!

It's all up now!" he was told in Russian, German, and Czech by the crowd of fugiti es who understood what was happening as little as he did.

"Kill the Germans!" shouted one.

"May the de il take them     the traitors!"

"Zum Henker diese Russen!"   muttered a German.   "Hang these Russians!"

Se eral wounded men passed along the road, and words of abuse, screams, and groans mingled in a general hubbub, then the firing died down.

Rosto  learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had been firing at one another.

"My God! What does it all mean?" thought he. "And here, where at any moment the Emperor may see them.... But no, these must be only a handful of scoundrels.

It will soon be o er, it can't be that, it can't be! Only to get past them quicker, quicker!"

The idea of defeat and flight could not enter Rosto 's head.

Though he saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights just where he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief, he could not, did not wish to, belie e that.

CHAPTER X III

Rosto  had been ordered to look for Kutuzo  and the Emperor near the  illage of Pratzen.

But neither they nor a single commanding officer were there, only disorganized crowds of troops of  arious kinds.

He urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but the farther he went the more disorganized they were.

The highroad on which he had come out was thronged with caleches, carriages of all sorts, and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and some not.

This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries stationed on the Pratzen Heights.

"Where is the Emperor? Where is Kutuzo ?" Rosto  kept asking e eryone he could stop, but got no answer from anyone.

At last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer.

"Eh, brother!

They' e all bolted long ago!" said the soldier, laughing for some reason and shaking himself free.

Ha ing left that soldier who was e idently drunk, Rosto  stopped the horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to question him.

The man announced that the Tsar had been dri en in a carriage at full speed about an hour before along that  ery road and that he was dangerously wounded.

"It can't be!" said Rosto . "It must ha e been someone else."

"I saw him myself," replied the man with a self confident smile of derision. "I ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times I' e seen him in Petersburg. I saw him just as I see you....

There he sat in the carriage as pale as anything.

How they made the four black horses fly! Gracious me, they did rattle past! It's time I knew the Imperial horses and Ilya I anych. I don't think Ilya dri es anyone except the Tsar!"

Rosto  let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a wounded officer passing by addressed him 

"Who is it you want?" he asked. "The commander in chief?

He was killed by a cannon ball     struck in the breast before our regiment."

"Not killed     wounded!" another officer corrected him.

"Who?

Kutuzo ?" asked Rosto .

"Not Kutuzo , but what's his name     well, ne er mind... there are not many left ali e.

Go that way, to that  illage, all the commanders are there," said the officer, pointing to the  illage of Hosjeradek, and he walked on.

Rosto  rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now going.

The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost.

It was impossible to doubt it now.

Rosto  rode in the direction pointed out to him, in which he saw turrets and a church.

What need to hurry?

What was he now to say to the Tsar or to Kutuzo , e en if they were ali e and unwounded?

"Take this road, your honor, that way you will be killed at once!" a soldier shouted to him. "They'd kill you there!"

"Oh, what are you talking about?" said another. "Where is he to go?

That way is nearer."

Rosto  considered, and then went in the direction where they said he would be killed.

"It's all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to sa e myself?" he thought.

He rode on to the region where the greatest number of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen.

The French had not yet occupied that region, and the Russians     the uninjured and slightly wounded     had left it long ago.

All about the field, like heaps of manure on well kept plowland, lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of acres.

The wounded crept together in twos and threes and one could hear their distressing screams and groans, sometimes feigned     or so it seemed to Rosto .

He put his horse to a trot to a oid seeing all these suffering men, and he felt afraid     afraid not for his life, but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight of these unfortunates.

The French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and wounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing an adjutant riding o er it trained a gun on him and fired se eral shots.

The sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around him merged in Rosto 's mind into a single feeling of terror and pity for himself.

He remembered his mother's last letter.

"What would she feel," thought he, "if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed at me?"

In the  illage of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from the field of battle, who though still in some confusion were less disordered.

The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire sounded far away.

Here e eryone clearly saw and said that the battle was lost.

No one whom Rosto  asked could tell him where the Emperor or Kutuzo  was.

Some said the report that the Emperor was wounded was correct, others that it was not, and explained the false rumor that had spread by the fact that the Emperor's carriage had really galloped from the field of battle with the pale and terrified Ober Hofmarschal Count Tolstoy, who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the Emperor's suite.

One officer told Rosto  that he had seen someone from headquarters behind the  illage to the left, and thither Rosto  rode, not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience.

When he had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian troops, he saw, near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two men on horseback facing the ditch.

One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to Rosto   the other on a beautiful chestnut horse (which Rosto  fancied he had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his horse with his spurs, and gi ing it the rein leaped lightly o er.

Only a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horse's hind hoofs.

Turning the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes, e idently suggesting that he should do the same.

The rider, whose figure seemed familiar to Rosto  and in oluntarily ri eted his attention, made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture Rosto  instantly recognized his lamented and adored monarch.

"But it can't be he, alone in the midst of this empty field!" thought Rosto .

At that moment Alexander turned his head and Rosto  saw the belo ed features that were so deeply engra ed on his memory.

The Emperor was pale, his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the charm, the mildness of his features, was all the greater.

Rosto  was happy in the assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were false.

He was happy to be seeing him.

He knew that he might and e en ought to go straight to him and gi e the message Dolgoruko  had ordered him to deli er.

But as a youth in lo e trembles, is unner ed, and dares not utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but looks around for help or a chance of delay and flight when the longed for moment comes and he is alone with her, so Rosto , now that he had attained what he had longed for more than anything else in the world, did not know how to approach the Emperor, and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be incon enient, unseemly, and impossible to do so.

"What!

It is as if I were glad of a chance to take ad antage of his being alone and despondent!

A strange face may seem unpleasant or painful to him at this moment of sorrow  besides, what can I say to him now, when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of him?"

Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall.

Those speeches were intended for quite other conditions, they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment of  ictory and triumph, generally when he was dying of wounds and the so ereign had thanked him for heroic deeds, and while dying he expressed the lo e his actions had pro ed.

"Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right flank now that it is nearly four o'clock and the battle is lost?

No, certainly I must not approach him, I must not intrude on his reflections.

Better die a thousand times than risk recei ing an unkind look or bad opinion from him," Rosto  decided  and sorrowfully and with a heart full despair he rode away, continually looking back at the Tsar, who still remained in the same attitude of indecision.

While Rosto  was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away, Captain  on Toll chanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing the Emperor at once rode up to him, offered his ser ices, and assisted him to cross the ditch on foot.

The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling unwell, sat down under an apple tree and  on Toll remained beside him.

Rosto  from a distance saw with en y and remorse how  on Toll spoke long and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor, e idently weeping, co ered his eyes with his hand and pressed  on Toll's hand.

"And I might ha e been in his place!" thought Rosto , and hardly restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he rode on in utter despair, not knowing where to or why he was now riding.

His despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was the cause of his grief.

He might... not only might but should, ha e gone up to the so ereign.

It was a unique chance to show his de otion to the Emperor and he had not made use of it....

"What ha e I done?" thought he.

And he turned round and galloped back to the place where he had seen the Emperor, but there was no one beyond the ditch now.

Only some carts and carriages were passing by.

From one of the dri ers he learned that Kutuzo 's staff were not far off, in the  illage the  ehicles were going to.

Rosto  followed them.

In front of him walked Kutuzo 's groom leading horses in horsecloths.

Then came a cart, and behind that walked an old, bandy legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat.

"Tit! I say, Tit!" said the groom.

"What?" answered the old man absent mindedly.

"Go, Tit!

Thresh a bit!"

"Oh, you fool!" said the old man, spitting angrily.

Some time passed in silence, and then the same joke was repeated.

Before fi e in the e ening the battle had been lost at all points.

More than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French.

Przebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms.

Other columns after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused masses.

The remains of Langeron's and Dokhturo 's mingled forces were crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the  illage of Augesd.

After fi e o'clock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot cannonade (deli ered by the French alone) was still to be heard from numerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights, directed at our retreating forces.

In the rearguard, Dokhturo  and others rallying some battalions kept up a musketry fire at the French ca alry that was pursuing our troops.

It was growing dusk.

On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully angling, while his grandson, with shirt slee es rolled up, handled the floundering sil ery fish in the watering can, on that dam o er which for so many years Mora ians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully dri en their two horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts     on that narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon, under the horses' hoofs and between the wagon wheels, men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together, crushing one another, dying, stepping o er the dying and killing one another, only to mo e on a few steps and be killed themsel es in the same way.

E ery ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around, or a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, killing some and splashing with blood those near them.

Dolokho      now an officer     wounded in the arm, and on foot, with the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company, represented all that was left of that whole regiment.

Impelled by the crowd, they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and, jammed in on all sides, had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a cannon and the crowd were dragging it out.

A cannon ball killed someone behind them, another fell in front and splashed Dolokho  with blood.

The crowd, pushing forward desperately, squeezed together, mo ed a few steps, and again stopped.

"Mo e on a hundred yards and we are certainly sa ed, remain here another two minutes and it is certain death," thought each one.

Dolokho  who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge of the dam, throwing two soldiers off their feet, and ran onto the slippery ice that co ered the millpool.

"Turn this way!" he shouted, jumping o er the ice which creaked under him  "turn this way!" he shouted to those with the gun. "It bears!..."

The ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, and it was plain that it would gi e way not only under a cannon or a crowd, but  ery soon e en under his weight alone.

The men looked at him and pressed to the bank, hesitating to step onto the ice.

The general on horseback at the entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address Dolokho .

Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low abo e the crowd that e eryone ducked.

It flopped into something moist, and the general fell from his horse in a pool of blood.

Nobody ga e him a look or thought of raising him.

"Get onto the ice, o er the ice!

Go on! Turn! Don't you hear?

Go on!" innumerable  oices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the general, the men themsel es not knowing what, or why, they were shouting.

One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the ice.

Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond.

The ice ga e way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg slipped into the water. He tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist.

The nearest soldiers shrank back, the gun dri er stopped his horse, but from behind still came the shouts 

"Onto the ice, why do you stop? Go on! Go on!"

And cries of horror were heard in the crowd.

The soldiers near the gun wa ed their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and mo e on.

The horses mo ed off the bank.

The ice, that had held under those on foot, collapsed in a great mass, and some forty men who were on it dashed, some forward and some back, drowning one another.

Still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that co ered the dam, the pond, and the bank.

CHAPTER XIX

On the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand, lay Prince Andrew Bolkonski bleeding profusely and unconsciously uttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan.

Toward e ening he ceased moaning and became quite still.

He did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted.

Suddenly he again felt that he was ali e and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head.

"Where is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw today?" was his first thought.

"And I did not know this suffering either," he thought. "Yes, I did not know anything, anything at all till now.

But where am I?"

He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and  oices speaking French.

He opened his eyes.

Abo e him again was the same lofty sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher, and between them gleamed blue infinity.

He did not turn his head and did not see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and  oices, had ridden up and stopped near him.

It was Napoleon accompanied by two aides de camp.

Bonaparte riding o er the battlefield had gi en final orders to strengthen the batteries firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left on the field.

"Fine men!" remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier, who, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape, lay on his stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide.

"The ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, Your Majesty," said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at Augesd.

"Ha e some brought from the reser e," said Napoleon, and ha ing gone on a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his back with the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him. (The flag had already been taken by the French as a trophy.)

"That's a fine death!" said Napoleon as he gazed at Bolkonski.

Prince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was Napoleon who said it.

He heard the speaker addressed as Sire.

But he heard the words as he might ha e heard the buzzing of a fly.

Not only did they not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at once forgot them.

His head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to death, and he saw abo e him the remote, lofty, and e erlasting sky.

He knew it was Napoleon     his hero     but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a small, insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying o er it.

At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing o er him, or what was said of him  he was only glad that people were standing near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life, which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to understand it so differently.

He collected all his strength, to stir and utter a sound.

He feebly mo ed his leg and uttered a weak, sickly groan which aroused his own pity.

"Ah! He is ali e," said Napoleon. "Lift this young man up and carry him to the dressing station."

Ha ing said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who, hat in hand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the  ictory.

Prince Andrew remembered nothing more  he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while being mo ed, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station.

He did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when with other wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital.

During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and e en speak.

The first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French con oy officer, who said rapidly 

"We must halt here  the Emperor will pass here immediately  it will please him to see these gentlemen prisoners."

"There are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole Russian army, that he is probably tired of them," said another officer.

"All the same!

They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor Alexander's Guards," said the first one, indicating a Russian officer in the white uniform of the Horse Guards.

Bolkonski recognized Prince Repnin whom he had met in Petersburg society.

Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of the Horse Guards.

Bonaparte, ha ing come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.

"Which is the senior?" he asked, on seeing the prisoners.

They named the colonel, Prince Repnin.

"You are the commander of the Emperor Alexander's regiment of Horse Guards?" asked Napoleon.

"I commanded a squadron," replied Repnin.

"Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably," said Napoleon.

"The praise of a great commander is a soldier's highest reward," said Repnin.

"I bestow it with pleasure," said Napoleon. "And who is that young man beside you?"

Prince Repnin named Lieutenant Sukhtelen.

After looking at him Napoleon smiled.

"He's  ery young to come to meddle with us."

"Youth is no hindrance to courage," muttered Sukhtelen in a failing  oice.

"A splendid reply!" said Napoleon. "Young man, you will go far!"

Prince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the Emperor's eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his attention.

Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield and, addressing him, again used the epithet "young man" that was connected in his memory with Prince Andrew.

"Well, and you, young man," said he. "How do you feel, mon bra e?"

Though fi e minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to say a few words to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes fixed straight on Napoleon, he was silent.... So insignificant at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so mean did his hero himself with his paltry  anity and joy in  ictory appear, compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he had seen and understood, that he could not answer him.

E erything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood, suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him.

Looking into Napoleon's eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and the still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one ali e could understand or explain.

The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of the officers as he went 

"Ha e these gentlemen attended to and taken to my bi ouac  let my doctor, Larrey, examine their wounds.

Au re oir, Prince Repnin!" and he spurred his horse and galloped away.

His face shone with self satisfaction and pleasure.

The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother's neck, but seeing the fa or the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now hastened to return the holy image.

Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform.

"It would be good," thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icon his sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and re erence, "it would be good if e erything were as clear and simple as it seems to Mary.

How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life, and what to expect after it beyond the gra e!

How happy and calm I should be if I could now say  'Lord, ha e mercy on me!'... But to whom should I say that?

Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible, which I not only cannot address but which I cannot e en express in words     the Great All or Nothing " said he to himself, "or to that God who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary!

There is nothing certain, nothing at all except the unimportance of e erything I understand, and the greatness of something incomprehensible but all important."

The stretchers mo ed on.

At e ery jolt he again felt unendurable pain  his fe erishness increased and he grew delirious.

 isions of his father, wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt the night before the battle, the figure of the insignificant little Napoleon, and abo e all this the lofty sky, formed the chief subjects of his delirious fancies.

The quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented itself to him.

He was already enjoying that happiness when that little Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of shortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts and torments had followed, and only the hea ens promised peace.

Toward morning all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of unconciousness and obli ion which in the opinion of Napoleon's doctor, Larrey, was much more likely to end in death than in con alescence.

"He is a ner ous, bilious subject," said Larrey, "and will not reco er."

And Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was left to the care of the inhabitants of the district.
